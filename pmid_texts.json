Matching ppm values were obtained from the PaxDb database, which contains tissue-specific expression levels of approximately 19,000 proteins.\naCalculated from the difference in the total body receptor amount and tissue receptor amounts from the PaxDb database according to Equations 5 and 6.\nWe used Equation 1 with parameter values listed in Table 1 and mass spectrometric ppm tissue concentration values from the PaxDb database to calculate EGFR and HER2 concentrations in the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skin, and the body as a whole.\nVisual inspection of the plots in Figure 4 and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values presented in indicate that the best fit is achieved when the membrane target is assigned to organ vascular and interstitial spaces whilst co-fitting the internalization rate constant kint and adjusting the overall target expression level. The best fitting scenarios imply 3-fold lower tissue concentrations for EGFR and 6-fold lower concentrations for HER2 compared to the concentrations predicted from the PaxDb proteomics data presented in the sigmoidal correlation model (Table 2).\nIn this study, we demonstrate that the ppm tissue protein concentration values stored in the mass spectrometric PaxDb database can be related to molarity.\nIn this study, we demonstrate that the ppm tissue protein concentration values stored in the mass spectrometric PaxDb database can be related to molarity. This complements our previous work where we established a similar correlation for plasma proteins and thus allows organ molar concentration estimates for cell-linked proteins listed in the PaxDb, which contains data for thousands of proteins across many species and organs, to be obtained.\nAlthough the formalism is the same as that applied to plasma and tissue proteins, the parameter values are different for the two data sets. In the case of plasma proteins, both molar and relative concentration values stretch to eight orders of magnitude, while in the case of tissue proteins, the variation is about six orders of magnitude for ppm values from the PaxDb database and about three orders of magnitude for the molar concentration values that we calculated from the results obtained by Wegler et al.\nFor the development of the tissue protein model, we assumed that the ppm values from the PaxDb database represent liver protein expression in healthy humans.\n Consequently, we recommend use of the measured tissue concentrations in the patient group of interest, if that data is available. The PaxDb database would be a fallback choice for when no such information is available, a situation most likely to be encountered in the case of tissue-embedded targets or early stage predictive evaluation of target likely druggability.\n This suggests that PK and engagement predictions for novel mAbs can be considered if there is reliable estimate for the target-mediated drug degradation rate constant. Given that the PaxDb database describes endogenous proteins, the information retrieved can also be expected to guide quantitative systems pharmacology models.\n",

Difficulties in obtaining comparative protein abundance data can be bypassed by referring to standard abundance values derived from publicly available mass spectrometry data, such as has been done for Arabidopsis at paxdb.\nIn 2012, 46 Arabidopsis proteomes containing spectral data from over 20\u00a0589 proteins were combined to make the first relative abundance estimate of Arabidopsis proteins in a theoretical whole\u2010organism proteome, housed at paxdb.\n However, data for these proteins can only be incorporated into an in silico scoring system if it is possible to appropriately scale data from enrichments into the tissue data. Therefore, the first challenges in expanding the current in silico PAS system were to curate all useable enrichment data and integrate these into the existing PaxDb score.\n Using protoplasts prevented analysis of the cell wall, but this region has been well covered in several recent proteomes, summarized in San Clemente and Jamet (2015). Peptides from newly acquired datasets, and published datasets for which peptide spectral matches were available, were then scored using the same method as used at paxdb.\n Publications containing only protein\u2010level spectral data were also scored and included, as detailed in the Experimental Procedures.

NPAS was then compared with the original PaxDb scores, which covered 76% of the predicted Arabidopsis proteome (Wang et\u00a0al.\n, 2012a). NPAS distribution was considerably less bimodal than PaxDb scores, indicating more accurate protein scoring (Figure\u00a01c), and NPAS increased the total Arabidopsis proteome coverage by almost 10% (Figure\u00a01a).\n Proteins were assigned to locations using a collection of high\u2010confidence (HC) organelle markers (Table\u00a0S3), as detailed in the subsequent results section, and the distribution of markers for each subcellular compartment occurring along the NPAS scale was plotted (b).

To compute this score, we first import protein\u2013protein interaction information from the STRING database 22, separately for each organism in PaxDb.\nSince PaxDb does not reprocess raw MS data, and since it does not reexecute peptide\u2010spectrum matching searches, the search parameter settings and false discovery rates (FDR) of the original submitters are always retained.\n Because there are several hundred of these receptors encoded in the human genome, they do represent a broad and universal test set of likely \u201cfalse\u2010positive\u201d protein identifications (except, of course, for samples originating in nasal tissues and perhaps some other, inherently \u201cleaky\u201d tissues 24). We have implemented this test on all human abundance datasets in PaxDb 4.\n0, and indeed observe variable levels of inferred FDR across datasets (Supporting Information Table 1). This led us to block a small number of datasets from further inclusion in PaxDb, and the remainder of the data usually exhibit estimated FDRs of 5% or better, many even at 1% or better.\nOne of the unique features of PaxDb is its seamless comparability of data across organisms.\n This allows insights in protein abundance evolution, such as abundance conservation in the eukaryotic core proteome 21, 25, 26, cost\u2010diversity tradeoffs during evolution 27, or the fate of paralogs during evolutionary network rewiring 28. Orthology relationships in PaxDb are precomputed, through the eggNOG mechanism 29, and can be browsed at various levels of phylogenetic depth (e.\n All data in this figure are from version 3.0 of PaxDb.\nThese and similar studies represent some of the use cases that PaxDb was designed for, but many other usage scenarios will undoubtedly surface with each new data release.\n",

Next, we compare the concentrations of these proteins used in the in vitro LLPS experiments to their cellular abundance levels, measured in mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics studies, obtained from PaxDb.\n3, for details and Supplementary Table S3 for the assembled dataset). Tissue-specific and cell-line integrated abundance values retrieved from PaxDb, available for 75 proteins of the consolidated subset, were converted to concentrations using a published formula and plotted for the same set of proteins for comparison (see Methods Section 3.\ng., Csat) at which a protein undergoes LLPS can be used to deduce that the observed process is physiologically relevant, we decided to compare only the lowest in vitro concentration where a given protein was observed to phase separate (ideally, Csat) to the highest of its PaxDb-derived cellular concentrations.\nThis second comparison (see Supplementary Figure S2) reveals that only 25 of the 75 proteins (33.3%) could undergo LLPS in vitro at a concentration that is within the range of its PaxDb-derived cellular concentrations (their lowest in vitro concentration is lower than the highest PaxDb value).\n3%) could undergo LLPS in vitro at a concentration that is within the range of its PaxDb-derived cellular concentrations (their lowest in vitro concentration is lower than the highest PaxDb value). For the remaining proteins, the lowest in vitro concentration was higher than the corresponding highest PaxDb concentration by less than (17 proteins; 22.\nFirst, we note that the cellular protein abundance values obtained from PaxDb are derived from quantitative proteomics studies that measure the number of protein copies per cell.\n This assumption seems to be the premise for using measures or estimates of in vivo local protein concentrations to define the protein concentration range used in a sizable fraction of the in vitro studies. However, it is not always clear what they represent: do they refer to the concentrations inside the condensates or do they also include the surrounding local \u2018bulk\u2019 proteins? In either case, they are expected to be significantly higher than the corresponding PaxDb values.\nAmong our studied LLPS driver proteins, local translation reportedly applies to postsynaptic-density (PSD) proteins in nerve terminals, such as PSD-95 (gene DLG4), SynGAP (gene SYNGAP1), Homer-3 (HOMER3), and Synapsin-1 (gene SYN1), which reach local concentrations of ~100 \u03bcM in quantitative proteomics studies of purified postsynaptic densities and nerve terminals. These high local concentrations justify the use of the respective in vitro LLPS concentrations over those of the much lower PaxDb-derived cellular concentrations (1.\n062 \u03bcM for PSD-95, SynGAP, and Homer-3, respectively). Examples of very high local in vivo concentrations of LLPS drivers due to being specifically anchored to repetitive binding sites on larger, slowly-diffusing macromolecular entities in the cell (such as RNA, DNA, or membranes), include the RNA polymerase II subunit encoded by gene POLR2A, for which all PaxDb-derived concentrations are below 0.\nProteomics-derived protein abundance values were obtained from the integrated datasets of PaxDb, the Protein Abundance Database (version 4.\n1). To this end, UniProt ACs provided by the LLPS databases were mapped onto Ensembl protein IDs and abundance data available for the latter have been retrieved from PaxDb.\n If there were multiple available (tissue-specific or cell line integrated) abundance values for a protein, we accepted all to gain distribution of data rather than a single data point. The PaxDb abundance values reported in ppm (parts-per-million) as units were converted to micromolar concentrations using the below formula Equation (1) from, where k \u2248 3\u00b7106 proteins/fL, the Avogadro constant NA = 6.\n This allowed comparisons with the in vitro applied LLPS protein concentrations retrieved from LLPSDB and the literature. For some of the gene products, like those of the LAT (transmembrane), SYN2 (membrane-anchored), and YTHDF3 genes, PaxDb did not have any abundance values, so we only show the concentrations reported for their in vitro LLPS experiments in the concentration graphs without a comparison.\nThe publications reporting on the in vitro LLPS experiments performed for human LLPS proteins were screened for author statements referring to published or calculated estimates of the physiologically relevant cellular or local concentrations of the investigated proteins. These concentrations were collected (where available) and used as reference values besides PaxDb-derived abundance-based concentrations.\nFor the abundance comparison depicted in Figure 4, the highest tissue- or cell line-specific integrated PaxDb value was obtained for each human protein with such PaxDb data in ppm (approximately the full proteome), and their frequency distribution was used as a reference to be compared to the highest abundances of LLPS driver proteins.\nEndeavoring to explain our findings on the systematically higher concentrations reported in in vitro LLPS studies than those measured for whole cells derived from quantitative proteomics (Figure 3) revealed that this trend is mainly due to the fact that in vitro studies often strive at reproducing the cellular context, albeit only imperfectly. Given that most LLPS-driver proteins display highly restricted patterns of subcellular localization, where they may encounter and interact with other (often) unbeknown cellular components, in vitro studies employ measurements or estimates of protein concentrations in local cellular niches to design their experiments, which are indeed expected to be much higher than the corresponding PaxDb values.\n Given that most LLPS-driver proteins display highly restricted patterns of subcellular localization, where they may encounter and interact with other (often) unbeknown cellular components, in vitro studies employ measurements or estimates of protein concentrations in local cellular niches to design their experiments, which are indeed expected to be much higher than the corresponding PaxDb values. Although these estimates are often imprecise because effective niche concentrations cannot be reliably measured by current quantitative proteomics techniques, they still represent effective (local) concentrations much better than PaxDb-derived values.\nProtein concentrations applied in in vitro LLPS experiments frequently exceed those calculated from proteomics-derived cellular protein abundances. Comparison of protein concentrations used in in vitro LLPS experiments (in blue), concentrations calculated from proteomics-derived cellular protein abundances stored in the PaxDb database (tissue-specific integrated values in orange and cell-line integrated values in green), and local concentrations estimated or referred to by authors (in red) for human LLPS driver proteins integrated from the three LLPS resources and filtered for in vitro verified true LLPS (co)drivers.\n Functional groups of the proteins are indicated on the top of the figure. For the products of genes LAT, SYN2, and YTHDF3, PaxDb concentration values were not available.\nHuman LLPS driver proteins are of relatively low abundance compared to the proteome average.

The workflow is as follows: 1) use PaxDB (https://pax-db.\n We initially sought to screen all commercially available C9ORF72 antibodies by immunoblot comparing parental and KO cell lines. We first referenced PaxDb, a comprehensive proteomic database that provides protein abundance across multiple organisms and tissues/cell lines (https://pax-db.\nBased on this experience we recommend that once immunoblot screens identify a specific antibody for a target of interest, the next step should involve screening panels of cell lines with that antibody to find those with the highest expression levels (Figure 1). While PaxDb appears to be effective to identify appropriate lines to start the analysis it is not infallible.\n One important consideration is the choice of a target-expressing cell line to initiate the studies. We used PaxDb, a proteomic database providing protein abundance across several tissues/cell types (https://pax-db.\norg/), which indicated that C9ORF72 is expressed in multiple cell lines (HEK-293, HeLa, U2OS) at equal or higher levels than brain, a result confirmed by quantitative immunoblot. PaxDb is useful but also limited in several respects.\n First, the reference mass spectrometry data is several years old but with continuing advances in proteomics and cell profiling approaches, it will becoming increasingly more accurate in general to predict appropriate cells lines for analysis. Moreover, PaxDb is limited to specific cell lines.\n In fact LRRK2 is most highly expressed in immune cells. Our study reveals that the highest levels of C9ORF72 are in macrophages and yet we could not determine this with PaxDb as the database has no proteomic data on this cell type.\nWe agree with the limitations of the PaxDb dataset, but are not in a position to generate new MS datasets.\n",
