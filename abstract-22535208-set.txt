Although protein expression is regulated both temporally and spatially, most 
proteins have an intrinsic, "typical" range of functionally effective abundance 
levels. These extend from a few molecules per cell for signaling proteins, to 
millions of molecules for structural proteins. When addressing fundamental 
questions related to protein evolution, translation and folding, but also in 
routine laboratory work, a simple rough estimate of the average wild type 
abundance of each detectable protein in an organism is often desirable. Here, we 
introduce a meta-resource dedicated to integrating information on absolute 
protein abundance levels; we place particular emphasis on deep coverage, 
consistent post-processing and comparability across different organisms. 
Publicly available experimental data are mapped onto a common namespace and, in 
the case of tandem mass spectrometry data, re-processed using a standardized 
spectral counting pipeline. By aggregating and averaging over the various 
samples, conditions and cell-types, the resulting integrated data set achieves 
increased coverage and a high dynamic range. We score and rank each 
contributing, individual data set by assessing its consistency against 
externally provided protein-network information, and demonstrate that our 
weighted integration exhibits more consistency than the data sets individually. 
The current PaxDb-release 2.1 (at http://pax-db.org/) presents whole-organism 
data as well as tissue-resolved data, and covers 85,000 proteins in 12 model 
organisms. All values can be seamlessly compared across organisms via 
pre-computed orthology relationships.

The seven 14-3-3 isoforms are highly abundant human proteins encoded by similar 
yet distinct genes. 14-3-3 proteins recognize phosphorylated motifs within 
numerous human and viral proteins. Here, we analyze by X-ray crystallography, 
fluorescence polarization, mutagenesis and fusicoccin-mediated modulation the 
structural basis and druggability of 14-3-3 binding to four E6 oncoproteins of 
tumorigenic human papillomaviruses. 14-3-3 isoforms bind variant and mutated 
phospho-motifs of E6 and unrelated protein RSK1 with different affinities, 
albeit following an ordered affinity ranking with conserved relative KD ratios. 
Remarkably, 14-3-3 isoforms obey the same hierarchy when binding to most of 
their established targets, as supported by literature and a recent human 
complexome map. This knowledge allows predicting proportions of 14-3-3 isoforms 
engaged with phosphoproteins in various tissues. Notwithstanding their 
individual functions, cellular concentrations of 14-3-3 may be collectively 
adjusted to buffer the strongest phosphorylation outbursts, explaining their 
expression variations in different tissues and tumors.

Effective delivery of therapeutics to the brain is challenging. Molecular 
shuttles use receptors expressed on brain endothelial cells to deliver 
therapeutics. Antibodies targeting transferrin receptor (TfR) have been widely 
developed as molecular shuttles. However, the TfR-based approach raises concerns 
about safety and developmental burden. Here, we report insulin-like growth 
factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) as an ideal target for the molecular shuttle. We also 
describe Grabody B, an antibody against IGF1R, as a molecular shuttle. Grabody B 
has broad cross-species reactivity and does not interfere with IGF1R-mediated 
signaling. We demonstrate that administration of Grabody B-fused 
anti-alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) antibody induces better improvement in 
neuropathology and behavior in a Parkinson's disease animal model than the 
therapeutic antibody alone due to its superior serum pharmacokinetics and 
enhanced brain exposure. The results indicate that IGF1R is an ideal shuttle 
target and Grabody B is a safe and efficient molecular shuttle.

Cells respond to their environment by modulating protein levels through mRNA 
transcription and post-transcriptional control. Modest observed correlations 
between global steady-state mRNA and protein measurements have been interpreted 
as evidence that mRNA levels determine roughly 40% of the variation in protein 
levels, indicating dominant post-transcriptional effects. However, the 
techniques underlying these conclusions, such as correlation and regression, 
yield biased results when data are noisy, missing systematically, and 
collinear---properties of mRNA and protein measurements---which motivated us to 
revisit this subject. Noise-robust analyses of 24 studies of budding yeast 
reveal that mRNA levels explain more than 85% of the variation in steady-state 
protein levels. Protein levels are not proportional to mRNA levels, but rise 
much more rapidly. Regulation of translation suffices to explain this nonlinear 
effect, revealing post-transcriptional amplification of, rather than competition 
with, transcriptional signals. These results substantially revise widely 
credited models of protein-level regulation, and introduce multiple noise-aware 
approaches essential for proper analysis of many biological phenomena.

It is generally believed that introns are not translated; therefore, the 
potential intronic features that may be related to the translation step 
(occurring after splicing) have yet to be thoroughly studied. Here, focusing on 
four fungi, we performed for the first time a comprehensive study aimed at 
characterizing how translation efficiency is encoded in introns and affects 
their evolution. By analysing their intronome we provide evidence of selection 
for STOP codons close to the intronic 5' end, and show that the beginning of 
introns are selected for significantly high translation, presumably to reduce 
translation and metabolic costs in cases of non-spliced introns. Ribosomal 
profiling data analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae supports the conjecture that 
in this organism intron retention frequently occurs, introns are partially 
translated, and their translation efficiency affects organismal fitness. We show 
that the reported results are more significant in highly translated and highly 
spliced genes, but are not associated only with genes with a specific function. 
We also discuss the potential relation of the reported signals to efficient 
nonsense-mediated decay due to splicing errors. These new discoveries are 
supported by population-genetics considerations. In addition, they are 
contributory steps towards a broader understanding of intron evolution and the 
effect of silent mutations on gene expression and organismal fitness.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-mediated signaling pathways regulate many physiological 
and pathophysiological processes in mammalian and plant systems. The molecular 
mechanism by which hydrogen sulfide exerts its action involves the 
posttranslational modification of cysteine residues to form a persulfidated 
thiol motif. We developed a comparative and label-free quantitative proteomic 
analysis approach for the detection of endogenous persulfidated proteins in 
N-starved Arabidopsis thaliana roots by using the tag-switch method. In this 
work, we identified 5214 unique proteins from root tissue that were 
persulfidated, 1674 of which were quantitatively analyzed and found to show 
altered persulfidation levels in vivo under N deprivation. These proteins 
represented almost 13% of the entire annotated proteome in Arabidopsis. 
Bioinformatic analysis revealed that persulfidated proteins were involved in a 
wide range of biological functions, regulating important processes such as 
primary metabolism, plant responses to stresses, growth and development, RNA 
translation and protein degradation. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis 
allowed us to obtain a comprehensive view of hydrogen sulfide signaling via 
changes in the persulfidation levels of key protein targets involved in 
ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and autophagy, among others.

The simple light isotope metabolic-labeling technique relies on the in vivo 
biosynthesis of amino acids from U-[12C]-labeled molecules provided as the sole 
carbon source. The incorporation of the resulting U-[12C]-amino acids into 
proteins presents several key advantages for mass-spectrometry-based proteomics 
analysis, as it results in more intense monoisotopic ions, with a better 
signal-to-noise ratio in bottom-up analysis. In our initial studies, we 
developed the simple light isotope metabolic (SLIM)-labeling strategy using 
prototrophic eukaryotic microorganisms, the yeasts Candida albicans and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as strains with genetic markers that lead to 
amino-acid auxotrophy. To extend the range of SLIM-labeling applications, we 
evaluated (i) the incorporation of U-[12C]-glucose into proteins of human cells 
grown in a complex RPMI-based medium containing the labeled molecule, 
considering that human cell lines require a large number of essential 
amino-acids to support their growth, and (ii) an indirect labeling strategy in 
which the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans grown on plates was fed 
U-[12C]-labeled bacteria (Escherichia coli) and the worm proteome analyzed for 
12C incorporation into proteins. In both cases, we were able to demonstrate 
efficient incorporation of 12C into the newly synthesized proteins, opening the 
way for original approaches in quantitative proteomics.

In eukaryotic organisms, subcellular protein location is critical in defining 
protein function and understanding sub-functionalization of gene families. Some 
proteins have defined locations, whereas others have low specificity targeting 
and complex accumulation patterns. There is no single approach that can be 
considered entirely adequate for defining the in vivo location of all proteins. 
By combining evidence from different approaches, the strengths and weaknesses of 
different technologies can be estimated, and a location consensus can be built. 
The Subcellular Location of Proteins in Arabidopsis database ( http://suba.live/ 
) combines experimental data sets that have been reported in the literature and 
is analyzing these data to provide useful tools for biologists to interpret 
their own data. Foremost among these tools is a consensus classifier (SUBAcon) 
that computes a proposed location for all proteins based on balancing the 
experimental evidence and predictions. Further tools analyze sets of proteins to 
define the abundance of cellular structures. Extending these types of resources 
to plant crop species has been complex due to polyploidy, gene family expansion 
and contraction, and the movement of pathways and processes within cells across 
the plant kingdom. The Crop Proteins of Annotated Location database ( 
http://crop-pal.org/ ) has developed a range of subcellular location resources 
including a species-specific voting consensus for 12 plant crop species that 
offers collated evidence and filters for current crop proteomes akin to SUBA. 
Comprehensive cross-species comparison of these data shows that the sub-cellular 
proteomes (subcellulomes) depend only to some degree on phylogenetic 
relationship and are more conserved in major biosynthesis than in metabolic 
pathways. Together SUBA and cropPAL created reference subcellulomes for plants 
as well as species-specific subcellulomes for cross-species data mining. These 
data collections are increasingly used by the research community to provide a 
subcellular protein location layer, inform models of compartmented cell function 
and protein-protein interaction network, guide future molecular crop breeding 
strategies, or simply answer a specific question-where is my protein of interest 
inside the cell?

The tumor microenvironment plays key roles in cancer biology, but its impact on 
the regulation of signaling pathway activity in cancer cells has not been 
systemically investigated. We designed an analytical strategy that allows 
differential analysis of signaling between cancer and stromal cells present in 
tumor xenografts. We used this approach to investigate how in vivo growth 
conditions and PI3K inhibitors regulate pathway activities in both cancer and 
stromal cell populations. We found that, despite inducing more modest changes in 
protein expression, in vivo growing conditions extensively rewired protein 
kinase networks in cancer cells. As a result, different sets of phosphorylation 
sites were modulated by PI3K inhibitors in cancer cells growing in tumors 
relative to when these cells were in culture. The p110δ PI3K-selective compound 
CAL-101 (Idelalisib) did not inhibit markers of PI3K activity in cancer or 
stromal cells; however, unexpectedly, it induced phosphorylation on SQ motifs in 
both subpopulations of tumor cells in vivo but not in vitro. Thus, the 
interaction between cancer cells and the stroma modulated the ability of PI3K 
inhibitors to induce the activation of apoptosis in solid tumors. Our study 
provides proof-of-principle of a proteomics workflow for measuring signaling 
specifically in cancer and stromal cells and for investigating how cancer 
biochemistry is modulated in vivo.

Pathogenic microbes have evolved complex secretion systems to deliver virulence 
factors into host cells. Identification of these factors is critical for 
understanding the infection process. We report a powerful and versatile approach 
to the selective labeling and identification of secreted pathogen proteins. 
Selective labeling of microbial proteins is accomplished via translational 
incorporation of azidonorleucine (Anl), a methionine surrogate that requires a 
mutant form of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase for activation. Secreted pathogen 
proteins containing Anl can be tagged by azide-alkyne cycloaddition and enriched 
by affinity purification. Application of the method to analysis of the type III 
secretion system of the human pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica enabled efficient 
identification of secreted proteins, identification of distinct secretion 
profiles for intracellular and extracellular bacteria, and determination of the 
order of substrate injection into host cells. This approach should be widely 
useful for the identification of virulence factors in microbial pathogens and 
the development of potential new targets for antimicrobial therapy.

Ribosome queuing is a fundamental phenomenon suggested to be related to topics 
such as genome evolution, synthetic biology, gene expression regulation, 
intracellular biophysics, and more. However, this phenomenon hasn't been 
quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying 
translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only 
single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability 
to detect ribosome queuing. On the other hand, most of the models in the field 
assume and analyze a certain level of queuing. Here we present an 
experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on 
sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a 
modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional 
ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data 
are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics. The approach 
was implemented on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome. Our data shows 
that ribosome queuing is more frequent than previously thought: the measured 
ratio of ribosomes within dRPFs to mRPFs is 0.2-0.35, suggesting that at least 
one to five translating ribosomes is in a traffic jam; these queued ribosomes 
cannot be captured by traditional methods. We found that specific regions are 
enriched with queued ribosomes, such as the 5'-end of ORFs, and regions upstream 
to mRPF peaks, among others. While queuing is related to higher density of 
ribosomes on the transcript (characteristic of highly translated genes), we 
report cases where traffic jams are relatively more severe in lowly expressed 
genes and possibly even selected for. In addition, our analysis demonstrates 
that higher adaptation of the coding region to the intracellular tRNA levels is 
associated with lower queuing levels. Our analysis also suggests that the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome undergoes selection for eliminating 
traffic jams. Thus, our proposed approach is an essential tool for high 
resolution analysis of ribosome traffic during mRNA translation and 
understanding its evolution.

Effective proteome analyses are based on interplay between resolution and 
detection. It had been claimed that resolution was the main factor limiting the 
use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Improved protein detection now 
indicates that this is unlikely to be the case. Using a highly refined protocol, 
the rat brain proteome was extracted, resolved, and detected. In order to 
overcome the stain saturation threshold, high abundance protein species were 
excised from the gel following standard imaging. Gels were then imaged again 
using longer exposure times, enabling detection of lower abundance, less 
intensely stained protein species. This resulted in a significant enhancement in 
the detection of resolved proteins, and a slightly modified digestion protocol 
enabled effective identification by standard mass spectrometric methods. The 
data indicate that the resolution required for comprehensive proteome analyses 
is already available, can assess multiple samples in parallel, and preserve 
critical information concerning post-translational modifications. Further 
optimization of staining and detection methods promises additional improvements 
to this economical, widely accessible and effective top-down approach to 
proteome analysis.

Proteolysis is a critical modification leading to alteration of protein function 
with important outcomes in many biological processes. However, for the majority 
of proteases, we have an incomplete understanding of both cellular substrates 
and downstream effects. Here, we describe detailed protocols and applications 
for using the rationally engineered peptide ligase, subtiligase, to specifically 
label and capture protein N-termini generated by proteases either induced or 
added to complex biological samples. This method allows identification of the 
protein targets as well as their precise cleavage locations. This approach has 
revealed >8000 proteolytic sites in healthy and apoptotic cells including >1700 
caspase cleavages. One can further determine substrate preferences through rate 
analysis with quantitative mass spectrometry, physiological substrate 
specificities, and even infer the identity of proteases operating in the cell. 
In this chapter, we also describe how this experimental method can be 
generalized to investigate proteolysis in any biological sample.

Of the 20 common amino acids, 18 are encoded by multiple synonymous codons. 
These synonymous codons are not redundant; in fact, all of codons contribute 
substantially to protein expression, structure and function. In this study, the 
codon usage pattern of genes in the E. coli was learned from the sequenced 
genomes of E. coli. A machine learning based method, Presyncodon was proposed to 
predict synonymous codon selection in E. coli based on the learned codon usage 
patterns of the residue in the context of the specific fragment. The predicting 
results indicate that Presycoden could be used to predict synonymous codon 
selection of the gene in the E. coli with the high accuracy. Two reporter genes 
(egfp and mApple) were designed with a combination of low- and 
high-frequency-usage codons by the method. The fluorescence intensity of eGFP 
and mApple expressed by the (egfp and mApple) designed by this method was about 
2.3- or 1.7- folds greater than that from the genes with only 
high-frequency-usage codons in E. coli. Therefore, both low- and 
high-frequency-usage codons make positive contributions to the functional 
expression of the heterologous proteins. This method could be used to design 
synthetic genes for heterologous gene expression in biotechnology.

Degeneracy in the genetic code implies that different codons can encode the same 
amino acid. Usage preference of synonymous codons has been observed in all 
domains of life. There is much evidence suggesting that this bias has a major 
role on protein elongation rate, contributing to differential expression and to 
co-translational folding. In addition to codon usage bias, other preference 
variations have been observed such as codon pairs. In this paper, I report that 
codon pairs have significant different frequency usage for coding either lowly 
or highly abundant proteins. These usage preferences cannot be explained by the 
frequency usage of the single codons. The statistical analysis of coding 
sequences of nine organisms reveals that in many cases bicodon preferences are 
shared between related organisms. Furthermore, it is observed that misfolding in 
the drug-transport protein, encoded by MDR1 gene, is better explained by a big 
change in the pause propensity due to the synonymous bicodon variant, rather 
than by a relatively small change in codon usage. These findings suggest that 
codon pair usage can be a more powerful framework to understand translation 
elongation rate, protein folding efficiency, and to improve protocols to 
optimize heterologous gene expression.

Defining intracellular protein concentration is critical in molecular systems 
biology. Although strategies for determining relative protein changes are 
available, defining robust absolute values in copies per cell has proven 
significantly more challenging. Here we present a reference data set quantifying 
over 1800Saccharomyces cerevisiaeproteins by direct means using protein-specific 
stable-isotope labeled internal standards and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) 
mass spectrometry, far exceeding any previous study. This was achieved by 
careful design of over 100 QconCAT recombinant proteins as standards, defining 
1167 proteins in terms of copies per cell and upper limits on a further 668, 
with robust CVs routinely less than 20%. The selected reaction 
monitoring-derived proteome is compared with existing quantitative data sets, 
highlighting the disparities between methodologies. Coupled with a 
quantification of the transcriptome by RNA-seq taken from the same cells, these 
data support revised estimates of several fundamental molecular parameters: a 
total protein count of ∼100 million molecules-per-cell, a median of ∼1000 
proteins-per-transcript, and a linear model of protein translation explaining 
70% of the variance in translation rate. This work contributes a "gold-standard" 
reference yeast proteome (including 532 values based on high quality, dual 
peptide quantification) that can be widely used in systems models and for other 
comparative studies.

Cellular stress responses require exquisite coordination between intracellular 
signaling molecules to integrate multiple stimuli and actuate specific cellular 
behaviors. Deciphering the web of complex interactions underlying stress 
responses is a key challenge in understanding robust biological systems and has 
the potential to lead to the discovery of targeted therapeutics for diseases 
triggered by dysregulation of stress response pathways. We constructed 
large-scale molecular interaction maps of six major stress response pathways in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's or budding yeast). Biological findings from 
over 900 publications were converted into standardized graphical formats and 
integrated into a common framework. The maps are posted at 
http://www.yeast-maps.org/yeast-stress-response/ for browse and curation by the 
research community. On the basis of these maps, we undertook systematic analyses 
to unravel the underlying architecture of the networks. A series of network 
analyses revealed that yeast stress response pathways are organized in bow-tie 
structures, which have been proposed as universal sub-systems for robust 
biological regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrated a potential role for 
complexes in stabilizing the conserved core molecules of bow-tie structures. 
Specifically, complex-mediated reversible reactions, identified by network motif 
analyses, appeared to have an important role in buffering the concentration and 
activity of these core molecules. We propose complex-mediated reactions as a key 
mechanism mediating robust regulation of the yeast stress response. Thus, our 
comprehensive molecular interaction maps provide not only an integrated 
knowledge base, but also a platform for systematic network analyses to elucidate 
the underlying architecture in complex biological systems.

The bacterial condensin MukB and the cellular decatenating enzyme topoisomerase 
IV interact. This interaction stimulates intramolecular reactions catalyzed by 
topoisomerase IV, supercoiled DNA relaxation, and DNA knotting but not 
intermolecular reactions such as decatenation of linked DNAs. We have 
demonstrated previously that MukB condenses DNA by sequestering negative 
supercoils and stabilizing topologically isolated loops in the DNA. We show here 
that the MukB-topoisomerase IV interaction stabilizes MukB on DNA, increasing 
the extent of DNA condensation without increasing the amount of MukB bound to 
the DNA. This effect does not require the catalytic activity of topoisomerase 
IV. Cells carrying a mukB mutant allele that encodes a protein that does not 
interact with topoisomerase IV exhibit severe nucleoid decompaction leading to 
chromosome segregation defects. These findings suggest that the 
MukB-topoisomerase IV complex may provide a scaffold for DNA condensation.

The P-glycoprotein efflux pump, encoded by the MDR1 gene, is an ATP-driven 
transporter capable of expelling a diverse array of compounds from cells. 
Overexpression of this protein is implicated in the multi-drug resistant 
phenotype observed in various cancers. Numerous studies have attempted to 
decipher the impact of genetic variants within MDR1 on P-glycoprotein 
expression, functional activity, and clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Among 
these, three specific single nucleotide polymorphisms-T1236C, T2677G, and T3435C 
- have been the focus of extensive research efforts, primarily through in vitro 
cell line models and clinical cohort analyses. However, the findings from these 
studies have been remarkably contradictory. In this study, we employ a 
computational, data-driven approach to systematically evaluate the effects of 
these three variants on principal stages of the gene expression process. 
Leveraging current knowledge of gene regulatory mechanisms, we elucidate 
potential mechanisms by which these variants could modulate P-glycoprotein 
levels and function. Our findings suggest that all three variants significantly 
change the mRNA folding in their vicinity. This change in mRNA structure is 
predicted to increase local translation elongation rates, but not to change the 
protein expression. Nonetheless, the increased translation rate near T3435C is 
predicted to affect the protein's co-translational folding trajectory in the 
region of the second ATP binding domain. This potentially impacts P-glycoprotein 
conformation and function. Our study demonstrates the value of computational 
approaches in elucidating the functional consequences of genetic variants. This 
framework provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of MDR1 variants 
and their potential impact on cancer prognosis and treatment resistance. 
Furthermore, we introduce an approach which can be systematically applied to 
identify mutations potentially affecting mRNA folding in pathology. We 
demonstrate the utility of this approach on both ClinVar and TCGA and identify 
hundreds of disease related variants that modify mRNA folding at essential 
positions.

Protein phosphorylation by kinases regulates mammalian cell functions, such as 
growth, division, and signal transduction. Among human kinases, NME1 and NME2 
are associated with metastatic tumor suppression but remain understudied due to 
the lack of tools to monitor their cellular substrates. In particular, NME1 and 
NME2 are multispecificity kinases phosphorylating serine, threonine, histidine, 
and aspartic acid residues of substrate proteins, and the heat and acid 
sensitivity of phosphohistidine and phosphoaspartate complicates substrate 
discovery and validation. To provide new substrate monitoring tools, we 
established the γ-phosphate-modified ATP analog, ATP-biotin, as a cosubstrate 
for phosphorylbiotinylation of NME1 and NME2 cellular substrates. Building upon 
this ATP-biotin compatibility, the Kinase-catalyzed Biotinylation with 
Inactivated Lysates for Discovery of Substrates method enabled validation of a 
known substrate and the discovery of seven NME1 and three NME2 substrates. Given 
the paucity of methods to study kinase substrates, ATP-biotin and the 
Kinase-catalyzed Biotinylation with Inactivated Lysates for Discovery of 
Substrates method are valuable tools to characterize the roles of NME1 and NME2 
in human cell biology.

Phosphorylation forms an important part of the signaling system that cells use 
for decision making and regulation of processes such as cell division and 
differentiation. In human, >90% of identified phosphosites do not have 
annotations regarding the relevant upstream kinase. At the same time around 30% 
of kinases (as annotated in UniProt) have no known target. This knowledge gap 
stresses the need to make large-scale, data-driven computational predictions. In 
this study, we have created a machine learning-based model to derive a 
probabilistic kinase-substrate network from omics datasets. Our methodology 
displays improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art 
kinase-substrate prediction methods and provides predictions for more kinases. 
Importantly, it better captures new experimentally identified kinase-substrate 
relationships. It can therefore allow the improved prioritization of 
kinase-substrate pairs for illuminating the dark human cell signaling space. Our 
model is integrated into a web server, SELPHI2.0, to allow unbiased analysis of 
phosphoproteomics data, facilitating the design of downstream experiments to 
uncover mechanisms of signal transduction across conditions and cellular 
contexts.

Directly using the promoter associated with 5'-untranslated region of a 
high-protein-abundance gene from the genome may cause low expression activity of 
an expression system. A bicistronic expression part containing the short 5' 
coding sequence of the source gene and an embedded Shine-Dalgarno sequence can 
cause higher expression levels of the recombinant gene in a bicistronic 
cassette. Here, we evaluated two methods to construct expression parts and 
exploited genomic sequence sources to provide specific functional sequences to 
complete the expression system. The architecture of the bicistronic part 
increased the expression levels of target genes and performed more reliably than 
conventional expression parts with the same promoter and 5' untranslated region. 
For Corynebacterium glutamicum, the strongest bicistronic part, HP-BEP4, was 
obtained from a heterologous sequence source, leading to a 2.24-fold increase in 
the expression level of fluorescent protein over constitutively expressed pXMJ19 
or the production of more than 100 mg/L single-chain variable fragment (scFv). 
It could meet the needs of overexpressing key genes in C. glutamicum.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a diverse family of essential transcriptional 
regulatory enzymes, that function through the spatial and temporal recruitment 
of protein complexes. As the composition and regulation of HDAC complexes are 
only partially characterized, we built the first global protein interaction 
network for all 11 human HDACs in T cells. Integrating fluorescence microscopy, 
immunoaffinity purifications, quantitative mass spectrometry, and 
bioinformatics, we identified over 200 unreported interactions for both 
well-characterized and lesser-studied HDACs, a subset of which were validated by 
orthogonal approaches. We establish HDAC11 as a member of the survival of motor 
neuron complex and pinpoint a functional role in mRNA splicing. We designed a 
complementary label-free and metabolic-labeling mass spectrometry-based 
proteomics strategy for profiling interaction stability among different HDAC 
classes, revealing that HDAC1 interactions within chromatin-remodeling complexes 
are largely stable, while transcription factors preferentially exist in rapid 
equilibrium. Overall, this study represents a valuable resource for 
investigating HDAC functions in health and disease, encompassing emerging themes 
of HDAC regulation in cell cycle and RNA processing and a deeper functional 
understanding of HDAC complex stability.

It was necessary to have a tool that could predict the amount of protein and 
optimize the gene sequences to produce recombinant proteins efficiently. The 
Transim model published by Tuller et al. in 2018 can calculate the translation 
rate in E. coli using features on the mRNA sequence, achieving a Spearman 
correlation with the amount of protein per mRNA of 0.36 when tested on the 
dataset of operons' first genes in E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome. However, this 
Spearman correlation was not high, and the model did not fully consider the 
features of mRNA and protein sequences. Therefore, to enhance the prediction 
capability, our study firstly tried expanding the testing dataset, adding genes 
inside the operon, and using the microarray of the mRNA expression data set, 
thereby helping to improve the correlation of translation rate with the amount 
of protein with more than 0.42. Next, the applicability of 6 traditional machine 
learning models to calculate a "new translation rate" was examined using 
initiation rate and elongation rate as inputs. The result showed that the SVR 
algorithm had the most correlated new translation rates, with Spearman 
correlation improving to R = 0.6699 with protein level output and to R = 0.6536 
with protein level per mRNA. Finally, the study investigated the degree of 
improvement when combining more features with the new translation rates. The 
results showed that the model's predictive ability to produce a protein per mRNA 
reached R = 0.6660 when using six features, while the correlation of this 
model's final translation rate to protein level was up to R = 0.6729. This 
demonstrated the model's capability to predict protein expression of a gene, 
rather than being limited to predicting expression by an mRNA and showed the 
model's potential for development into gene expression predicting tools.

N(6)-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t(6)A) is a universal tRNA modification 
essential for normal cell growth and accurate translation. In Archaea and 
Eukarya, the universal protein Sua5 and the conserved KEOPS/EKC complex together 
catalyze t(6)A biosynthesis. The KEOPS/EKC complex is composed of Kae1, a 
universal metalloprotein belonging to the ASHKA superfamily of ATPases; Bud32, 
an atypical protein kinase and two small proteins, Cgi121 and Pcc1. In this 
study, we investigated the requirement and functional role of KEOPS/EKC subunits 
for biosynthesis of t(6)A. We demonstrated that Pcc1, Kae1 and Bud32 form a 
minimal functional unit, whereas Cgi121 acts as an allosteric regulator. We 
confirmed that Pcc1 promotes dimerization of the KEOPS/EKC complex and uncovered 
that together with Kae1, it forms the tRNA binding core of the complex. Kae1 
binds l-threonyl-carbamoyl-AMP intermediate in a metal-dependent fashion and 
transfers the l-threonyl-carbamoyl moiety to substrate tRNA. Surprisingly, we 
found that Bud32 is regulated by Kae1 and does not function as a protein kinase 
but as a P-loop ATPase possibly involved in tRNA dissociation. Overall, our data 
support a mechanistic model in which the final step in the biosynthesis of t(6)A 
relies on a strictly catalytic component, Kae1, and three partner proteins 
necessary for dimerization, tRNA binding and regulation.

Hsp70 molecular chaperones are ubiquitous. By preventing aggregation, promoting 
folding, and regulating degradation, Hsp70s are major factors in the ability of 
cells to maintain proteostasis. Despite a wealth of functional information, 
little is understood about the evolutionary dynamics of Hsp70s. We undertook an 
analysis of Hsp70s in the fungal clade Ascomycota. Using the well-characterized 
14 Hsp70s of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified 491 orthologs from 53 
genomes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp70s fall into seven subfamilies: four 
canonical-type Hsp70 chaperones (SSA, SSB, KAR, and SSC) and three atypical 
Hsp70s (SSE, SSZ, and LHS) that play regulatory roles, modulating the activity 
of canonical Hsp70 partners. Each of the 53 surveyed genomes harbored at least 
one member of each subfamily, and thus establishing these seven Hsp70s as units 
of function and evolution. Genomes of some species contained only one member of 
each subfamily that is only seven Hsp70s. Overall, members of each subfamily 
formed a monophyletic group, suggesting that each diversified from their 
corresponding ancestral gene present in the common ancestor of all surveyed 
species. However, the pattern of evolution varied across subfamilies. At one 
extreme, members of the SSB subfamily evolved under concerted evolution. At the 
other extreme, SSA and SSC subfamilies exhibited a high degree of copy number 
dynamics, consistent with a birth-death mode of evolution. KAR, SSE, SSZ, and 
LHS subfamilies evolved in a simple divergent mode with little copy number 
dynamics. Together, our data revealed that the evolutionary history of this 
highly conserved and ubiquitous protein family was surprising complex and 
dynamic.

MOTIVATION: Protein evolution spans time scales and its effects span the length 
of an organism. A web app named ProteomeVis is developed to provide a 
comprehensive view of protein evolution in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 
Escherichia coli proteomes. ProteomeVis interactively creates protein chain 
graphs, where edges between nodes represent structure and sequence similarities 
within user-defined ranges, to study the long time scale effects of protein 
structure evolution. The short time scale effects of protein sequence evolution 
are studied by sequence evolutionary rate (ER) correlation analyses with protein 
properties that span from the molecular to the organismal level.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility and versatility of ProteomeVis by 
investigating the distribution of edges per node in organismal protein chain 
universe graphs (oPCUGs) and putative ER determinants. S.cerevisiae and E.coli 
oPCUGs are scale-free with scaling constants of 1.79 and 1.56, respectively. 
Both scaling constants can be explained by a previously reported theoretical 
model describing protein structure evolution. Protein abundance most strongly 
correlates with ER among properties in ProteomeVis, with Spearman correlations 
of -0.49 (P-value < 10-10) and -0.46 (P-value < 10-10) for S.cerevisiae and 
E.coli, respectively. This result is consistent with previous reports that found 
protein expression to be the most important ER determinant.

Natural genetic variation is the raw material of evolution and influences 
disease development and progression. An important question is how this genetic 
variation translates into variation in protein abundance. To analyze the effects 
of the genetic background on gene and protein expression in the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans, we quantitatively compared the two genetically highly 
divergent wild-type strains N2 and CB4856. Gene expression was analyzed by 
microarray assays, and proteins were quantified using stable isotope labeling by 
amino acids in cell culture. Among all transcribed genes, we found 1,532 genes 
to be differentially transcribed between the two wild types. Of the total 3,238 
quantified proteins, 129 proteins were significantly differentially expressed 
between N2 and CB4856. The differentially expressed proteins were enriched for 
genes that function in insulin-signaling and stress-response pathways, 
underlining strong divergence of these pathways in nematodes. The protein 
abundance of the two wild-type strains correlates more strongly than protein 
abundance versus transcript abundance within each wild type. Our findings 
indicate that in C. elegans only a fraction of the changes in protein abundance 
can be explained by the changes in mRNA abundance. These findings corroborate 
with the observations made across species.

Protein phosphorylation is one of the most prevalent and well-understood protein 
modifications. Oxidation of protein-bound methionine, which has been 
traditionally perceived as an inevitable damage derived from oxidative stress, 
is now emerging as another modification capable of regulating protein activity 
during stress conditions. However, the mechanism coupling oxidative signals to 
changes in protein function remains unknown. An appealing hypothesis is that 
methionine oxidation might serve as a rheostat to control phosphorylation. To 
investigate this potential crosstalk between phosphorylation and methionine 
oxidation, we have addressed the co-occurrence of these two types of 
modifications within the human proteome. Here, we show that nearly all (98%) 
proteins containing oxidized methionine were also phosphoproteins. Furthermore, 
phosphorylation sites were much closer to oxidized methionines when compared to 
non-oxidized methionines. This proximity between modification sites cannot be 
accounted for by their co-localization within unstructured clusters because it 
was faithfully reproduced in a smaller sample of structured proteins. We also 
provide evidence that the oxidation of methionine located within phosphorylation 
motifs is a highly selective process among stress-related proteins, which 
supports the hypothesis of crosstalk between methionine oxidation and 
phosphorylation as part of the cellular defence against oxidative stress.

Glycoproteins on the cell surface are ubiquitous and essential for cells to 
interact with the extracellular matrix, communicate with other cells, and 
respond to environmental cues. Although surface sialoglycoproteins can 
dramatically impact cell properties and represent different cellular statuses, 
global and site-specific analysis of sialoglycoproteins only on the cell surface 
is extraordinarily challenging. An effective method integrating metabolic 
labeling, copper-free click chemistry and mass spectrometry-based proteomics was 
developed to globally and site-specifically analyze surface 
N-sialoglycoproteins. Surface sialoglycoproteins metabolically labeled with a 
functional group were specifically tagged through copper-free click chemistry, 
which is ideal because it is quick, specific and occurs under physiological 
conditions. Sequentially tagged sialoglycoproteins were enriched for 
site-specific identification by mass spectrometry. Systematic and quantitative 
analysis of the surface N-sialoglycoproteome in cancer cells with distinctive 
invasiveness demonstrated many N-sialoglycoproteins up-regulated in invasive 
cells, the majority of which contained cell adhesion-related domains. This 
method is very effective to globally and site-specifically analyze 
N-sialoglycoproteins on the cell surface, and will have extensive applications 
in the biological and biomedical research communities. Site-specific information 
regarding surface sialoglycoproteins can serve as biomarkers for disease 
detection, targets for vaccine development and drug treatment.

BACKGROUND: The regulation of all gene expression steps (e.g., Transcription, 
RNA processing, Translation, and mRNA Degradation) is known to be primarily 
encoded in different parts of genes and in genomic regions in proximity to genes 
(e.g., promoters, untranslated regions, coding regions, introns, etc.). However, 
the entire gene expression codes and the genomic regions where they are encoded 
are still unknown.
RESULTS: Here, we employ an unsupervised approach to estimate the concentration 
of gene expression codes in different non-coding parts of genes and transcripts, 
such as introns and untranslated regions, focusing on three model organisms 
(Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Our 
analyses support the conjecture that regions adjacent to the beginning and end 
of ORFs and the beginning and end of introns tend to include higher 
concentration of gene expression information relatively to regions further away. 
In addition, we report the exact regions with elevated concentration of gene 
expression codes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the concentration of these 
codes in different genetic regions is correlated with the expression levels of 
the corresponding genes, and with splicing efficiency measurements and meiotic 
stage gene expression measurements in S. cerevisiae.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that these discoveries improve our understanding of gene 
expression regulation and evolution; they can also be used for developing 
improved models of genome/gene evolution and for engineering gene expression in 
various biotechnological and synthetic biology applications.

Codon bias analysis of SARS-CoV-2 reveals suboptimal adaptation for translation 
in human cells it infects. The detailed examination of the codons preferentially 
used by SARS-CoV-2 shows a strong preference for LysAAA, GlnCAA, GluGAA, and 
ArgAGA, which are infrequently used in human genes. In the absence of an adapted 
tRNA pool, efficient decoding of these codons requires a 
5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2) modification at the U34 wobble 
position of the corresponding tRNAs (tLysUUU; tGlnUUG; tGluUUC; tArgUCU). The 
optimal translation of SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs) may therefore 
require several adjustments to the host's translation machinery, enabling the 
highly biased viral genome to achieve a more favorable "Ready-to-Translate" 
state in human cells. Experimental approaches based on LC-MS/MS quantification 
of tRNA modifications and on alteration of enzymatic tRNA modification pathways 
provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 induces U34 
tRNA modifications and relies on these modifications for its lifecycle. The 
conclusions emphasize the need for future studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 
codon bias and its ability to alter the host tRNA pool through the manipulation 
of RNA modifications.

Global mRNA selection mechanisms for translation initiation.

Costello J, Castelli LM, Rowe W, Kershaw CJ, Talavera D, Mohammad-Qureshi SS, 
Sims PF, Grant CM, Pavitt GD, Hubbard SJ, Ashe MP.

BACKGROUND: The selection and regulation of individual mRNAs for translation 
initiation from a competing pool of mRNA are poorly understood processes. The 
closed loop complex, comprising eIF4E, eIF4G and PABP, and its regulation by 
4E-BPs are perceived to be key players. Using RIP-seq, we aimed to evaluate the 
role in gene regulation of the closed loop complex and 4E-BP regulation across 
the entire yeast transcriptome.
RESULTS: We find that there are distinct populations of mRNAs with coherent 
properties: one mRNA pool contains many ribosomal protein mRNAs and is enriched 
specifically with all of the closed loop translation initiation components. This 
class likely represents mRNAs that rely heavily on the closed loop complex for 
protein synthesis. Other heavily translated mRNAs are apparently 
under-represented with most closed loop components except Pab1p. Combined with 
data showing a close correlation between Pab1p interaction and levels of 
translation, these data suggest that Pab1p is important for the translation of 
these mRNAs in a closed loop independent manner. We also identify a 
translational regulatory mechanism for the 4E-BPs; these appear to self-regulate 
by inhibiting translation initiation of their own mRNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we show that mRNA selection for translation initiation is 
not as uniformly regimented as previously anticipated. Components of the closed 
loop complex are highly relevant for many mRNAs, but some heavily translated 
mRNAs interact poorly with this machinery. Therefore, alternative, possibly 
Pab1p-dependent mechanisms likely exist to load ribosomes effectively onto 
mRNAs. Finally, these studies identify and characterize a complex 
self-regulatory circuit for the yeast 4E-BPs.

BACKGROUND: Comparison between multiple protein datasets requires the choice of 
an appropriate reference system and a number of variables to describe their 
differences. Here we introduce an innovative approach to discriminate multiple 
protein datasets (multiCM) and to measure enrichments in gene ontology terms 
(cleverGO) using semantic similarities.
RESULTS: We illustrate the powerfulness of our approach by investigating the 
links between RNA-binding ability and other protein features, such as structural 
disorder and aggregation, in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, M. musculus and H. 
sapiens. Our results are in striking agreement with available experimental 
evidence and unravel features that are key to understand the mechanisms 
regulating cellular homeostasis.
CONCLUSIONS: In an intuitive way, multiCM and cleverGO provide accurate 
classifications of physico-chemical features and annotations of biological 
processes, molecular functions and cellular components, which is extremely 
useful for the discovery and characterization of new trends in protein datasets.

BACKGROUND: Proteins of the ubiquitously expressed core proteome are 
quantitatively correlated across multiple eukaryotic species. In addition, it 
was found that many protein paralogues exhibit expression anticorrelation, 
suggesting that the total level of protein with a given functionality must be 
kept constant.
METHODS: We performed Spearman's rank correlation analyses of gene expression 
levels for the RAS GTPase subfamily and their regulatory GEF and GAP proteins 
across tissues and across individuals for each tissue. A large set of published 
data for normal tissues from a wide range of species, human cancer tissues and 
human cell lines was analysed.
RESULTS: We show that although the multidomain regulatory proteins of Ras 
GTPases exhibit considerable tissue and individual gene expression variability, 
their total amounts are balanced in normal tissues. In a given tissue, the sum 
of activating (GEFs) and deactivating (GAPs) domains of Ras GTPases can vary 
considerably, but each person has balanced GEF and GAP levels. This balance is 
impaired in cell lines and in cancer tissues for some individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are relevant for critical considerations of knock out 
experiments, where functionally related homologs may compensate for the down 
regulation of a protein.

We present a method that quantifies nearly all pairwise amino acid 
substitutions, revealing the rates and spectra of mistranslation per amino acid 
and per codon. While determining error rates is illuminating, understanding why 
certain mistranslation events are enriched requires further exploration, 
particularly in relation to the translation-accuracy hypothesis. We found that 
codons favored in highly expressed genes are not predictive of translational 
fidelity and are not selected for translational accuracy. We evaluated our 
method using historically characterized ribosomal variants of Escherichia coli 
reported to differ in translation fidelity. However, we found no significant 
differences among their overall translation-error rates, estimated here to be ~2 
per 1,000 amino acids. Instead they each exhibited unique mistranslation 
profiles, which likely led to prior overestimates of the translation error-rate 
in the putative error-prone variant. Together, these results underscore the 
significance of a direct, proteome-wide measure of translation fidelity.

Liquid-liquid phase transitions govern a wide range of protein-protein and 
protein-RNA interactions. Although the importance of multivalency and protein 
disorder in driving these transitions is clear, there is limited knowledge 
concerning the structural basis of phase transitions or the conformational 
changes that accompany this process. In this work, we found that a small human 
protein, SERF2, is important for the formation of stress granules. We determined 
the solution NMR structure ensemble of SERF2. We show that SERF2 specifically 
interacts with non-canonical tetrahelical RNA structures called G-quadruplexes, 
structures linked to stress granule formation. The biophysical amenability of 
both SERF2 and RNA G4 quadruplexes have allowed us to characterize the 
multivalent protein-RNA interactions involved in liquid-liquid phase 
transitions, the role that protein disorder plays in these transitions, identify 
the specific contacts involved, and describe how these interactions impact the 
structural dynamics of the components enabling a detailed understanding of the 
structural transitions involved in early stages of ribonucleoprotein condensate 
formation.

RNA splicing is the central process of intron removal in eukaryotes known to 
regulate various cellular functions such as growth, development, and response to 
external signals. The canonical sequences indicating the splicing sites needed 
for intronic boundary recognition are well known. However, the roles and 
evolution of the local folding of intronic and exonic sequence features adjacent 
to splice sites has yet to be thoroughly studied. Here, focusing on four fungi 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus nidulans, and 
Candida albicans), we performed for the first time a comprehensive 
high-resolution study aimed at characterizing the encoding of intronic splicing 
efficiency in pre-mRNA transcripts and its effect on intron evolution. Our 
analysis supports the conjecture that pre-mRNA local folding strength at 
intronic boundaries is under selective pressure, as it significantly affects 
splicing efficiency. Specifically, we show that in the immediate region of 12-30 
nucleotides (nt) surrounding the intronic donor site there is a preference for 
weak pre-mRNA folding; similarly, in the region of 15-33 nt surrounding the 
acceptor and branch sites there is a preference for weak pre-mRNA folding. We 
also show that in most cases there is a preference for strong pre-mRNA folding 
further away from intronic splice sites. In addition, we demonstrate that these 
signals are not associated with gene-specific functions, and they correlate with 
splicing efficiency measurements (r = 0.77, P = 2.98 × 10(-21)) and with 
expression levels of the corresponding genes (P = 1.24 × 10(-19)). We suggest 
that pre-mRNA folding strength in the above-mentioned regions has a direct 
effect on splicing efficiency by improving the recognition of intronic 
boundaries. These new discoveries are contributory steps toward a broader 
understanding of splicing regulation and intronic/transcript evolution.

Molecular phylogenetic inference is inherently dependent on choices in both 
methodology and data. Many insightful studies have shown how choices in 
methodology, such as the model of sequence evolution or optimality criterion 
used, can strongly influence inference. In contrast, much less is known about 
the impact of choices in the properties of the data, typically genes, on 
phylogenetic inference. We investigated the relationships between 52 gene 
properties (24 sequence-based, 19 function-based, and 9 tree-based) with each 
other and with three measures of phylogenetic signal in two assembled data sets 
of 2,832 yeast and 2,002 mammalian genes. We found that most gene properties, 
such as evolutionary rate (measured through the percent average of pairwise 
identity across taxa) and total tree length, were highly correlated with each 
other. Similarly, several gene properties, such as gene alignment length, 
Guanine-Cytosine content, and the proportion of tree distance on internal 
branches divided by relative composition variability (treeness/RCV), were 
strongly correlated with phylogenetic signal. Analysis of partial correlations 
between gene properties and phylogenetic signal in which gene evolutionary rate 
and alignment length were simultaneously controlled, showed similar patterns of 
correlations, albeit weaker in strength. Examination of the relative importance 
of each gene property on phylogenetic signal identified gene alignment length, 
alongside with number of parsimony-informative sites and variable sites, as the 
most important predictors. Interestingly, the subsets of gene properties that 
optimally predicted phylogenetic signal differed considerably across our three 
phylogenetic measures and two data sets; however, gene alignment length and RCV 
were consistently included as predictors of all three phylogenetic measures in 
both yeasts and mammals. These results suggest that a handful of sequence-based 
gene properties are reliable predictors of phylogenetic signal and could be 
useful in guiding the choice of phylogenetic markers.

The RNA helicase UPF1 interacts with mRNAs, mRNA decay machinery, and the 
terminating ribosome to promote nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Structural 
and biochemical data have revealed that UPF1 exists in an enzymatically 
autoinhibited 'closed' state. Upon binding the NMD protein UPF2, UPF1 undergoes 
an extensive conformational change into a more enzymatically active 'open' 
state, which exhibits enhanced ATPase and helicase activity. However, 
mechanically deficient UPF1 mutants (i.e. poorly processive, slow, and 
mechanochemically uncoupled) can support efficient NMD, bringing into question 
the roles of UPF1 enzymatic autoinhibition and activation in NMD. Here, we 
identify two additional important features of the activated open state: slower 
RNA binding kinetics and enhanced ATP-stimulated RNA dissociation kinetics. 
Computational modeling based on empirical measurements of UPF1, UPF2 and RNA 
interaction kinetics predicts that the majority of UPF1-RNA binding and 
dissociation events in cells occur independently of UPF2 binding. We find that 
UPF1 mutants with either reduced or accelerated dissociation from RNA have NMD 
defects, whereas UPF1 mutants that are more dependent on UPF2 for catalytic 
activity remain active on well-established NMD targets. These findings support a 
model in which the kinetics of UPF1-mRNA interactions are important determinants 
of cellular NMD efficiency.

Computational modelling of the regulation of Insulin signalling by oxidative 
stress.

BACKGROUND: Existing models of insulin signalling focus on short term dynamics, 
rather than the longer term dynamics necessary to understand many 
physiologically relevant behaviours. We have developed a model of insulin 
signalling in rodent adipocytes that includes both transcriptional feedback 
through the Forkhead box type O (FOXO) transcription factor, and interaction 
with oxidative stress, in addition to the core pathway. In the model Reactive 
Oxygen Species are both generated endogenously and can be applied externally. 
They regulate signalling though inhibition of phosphatases and induction of the 
activity of Stress Activated Protein Kinases, which themselves modulate 
feedbacks to insulin signalling and FOXO.
RESULTS: Insulin and oxidative stress combined produce a lower degree of 
activation of insulin signalling than insulin alone. Fasting (nutrient 
withdrawal) and weak oxidative stress upregulate antioxidant defences while 
stronger oxidative stress leads to a short term activation of insulin signalling 
but if prolonged can have other effects including degradation of the insulin 
receptor substrate (IRS1) and FOXO. At high insulin the protective effect of 
moderate oxidative stress may disappear.
CONCLUSION: Our model is consistent with a wide range of experimental data, some 
of which is difficult to explain. Oxidative stress can have effects that are 
both up- and down-regulatory on insulin signalling. Our model therefore shows 
the complexity of the interaction between the two pathways and highlights the 
need for such integrated computational models to give insight into the 
dysregulation of insulin signalling along with more data at the individual 
level.A complete SBML model file can be downloaded from BIOMODELS

In order to achieve selective targeting of affinity-ligand coated nanoparticles 
to the target tissue, it is essential to understand the key mechanisms that 
govern their capture by the target cell. Next-generation pharmacokinetic (PK) 
models that systematically account for proteomic and mechanical factors can 
accelerate the design, validation and translation of targeted nanocarriers (NCs) 
in the clinic. Towards this objective, we have developed a computational model 
to delineate the roles played by target protein expression and mechanical 
factors of the target cell membrane in determining the avidity of functionalized 
NCs to live cells. Model results show quantitative agreement with in vivo 
experiments when specific and non-specific contributions to NC binding are taken 
into account. The specific contributions are accounted for through extensive 
simulations of multivalent receptor-ligand interactions, membrane mechanics and 
entropic factors such as membrane undulations and receptor translation. The 
computed NC avidity is strongly dependent on ligand density, receptor 
expression, bending mechanics of the target cell membrane, as well as entropic 
factors associated with the membrane and the receptor motion. Our computational 
model can predict the in vivo targeting levels of the intracellular adhesion 
molecule-1 (ICAM1)-coated NCs targeted to the lung, heart, kidney, liver and 
spleen of mouse, when the contributions due to endothelial capture are accounted 
for. The effect of other cells (such as monocytes, etc.) do not improve the 
model predictions at steady state. We demonstrate the predictive utility of our 
model by predicting partitioning coefficients of functionalized NCs in mice and 
human tissues and report the statistical accuracy of our model predictions under 
different scenarios.

Most cellular processes are regulated by groups of proteins interacting together 
to form protein complexes. Protein compositions vary between different tissues 
or disease conditions enabling or preventing certain protein-protein 
interactions and resulting in variations in the complexome. Quantitative and 
qualitative characterization of context-specific protein complexes will help to 
better understand context-dependent variations in the physiological behavior of 
cells. Here, we present SiComPre 1.0, a computational tool that predicts 
context-specific protein complexes by integrating multi-omics sources. SiComPre 
outperforms other protein complex prediction tools in qualitative predictions 
and is unique in giving quantitative predictions on the complexome depending on 
the specific interactions and protein abundances defined by the user. We provide 
tutorials and examples on the complexome prediction of common model organisms, 
various human tissues and how the complexome is affected by drug treatment.

Protein lysine deacetylases (KDACs), including the classic Zn(2+) -dependent 
histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+) 
)-requiring sirtuins, are enzymes that play critical roles in numerous 
biological processes, particularly the epigenetic regulation of global gene 
expression programs in response to internal and external cues. Dysregulation of 
KDACs is characteristic of several human diseases, including chronic metabolic, 
neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases and many cancers. This has led to 
the development of KDAC modulators, two of which (HDAC inhibitors vorinostat and 
romidepsin) have been approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. 
By their nature, existing KDAC modulators are relatively nonspecific, leading to 
pan-KDAC changes and undesired side effects. Given that KDACs are regulated at 
many levels, including transcriptional, post-translational, subcellular 
localization, and through their complexation with other proteins, it should be 
possible to affect specific KDAC activity through manipulation of endogenous 
signaling pathways. In this Minireview, we discuss our present knowledge of the 
cellular controls of KDAC activity and examples of their pharmacologic 
regulation.

Accurate molecular concentrations are essential for reliable analyses of 
biochemical networks and the creation of predictive models for molecular and 
systems biology, yet protein and metabolite concentrations used in such models 
are often poorly constrained or irreproducible. Challenges of using data from 
different sources include conflicts in nomenclature and units, as well as 
discrepancies in experimental procedures, data processing and implementation of 
the model. To obtain a consistent estimate of protein and metabolite levels, we 
integrated and normalized data from a large variety of sources to calculate 
Adjusted Molecular Concentrations. We found a high degree of reproducibility and 
consistency of many molecular species across brain regions and cell types, 
consistent with tight homeostatic regulation. We demonstrated the value of this 
normalization with differential protein expression analyses related to 
neurodegenerative diseases, brain regions and cell types. We also used the 
results in proof-of-concept simulations of brain energy metabolism. The 
standardized Brain Molecular Atlas overcomes the obstacles of missing or 
inconsistent data to support systems biology research and is provided as a 
resource for biomolecular modeling.

Amphipols (APols) are a newly designed and milder class of detergent. They have 
been used primarily in protein structure analysis for membrane protein trapping 
and stabilization. We have recently demonstrated that APols can be used as an 
alternative detergent for proteome extraction and digestion, to achieve a 
"One-stop" single-tube workflow for proteomics. In this workflow, APols are 
removed by precipitation after protein digestion without depleting the digested 
peptides. Here, we took further advantage of this precipitation characteristic 
of APols to concentrate proteins from diluted samples. In contrast with tryptic 
peptides, a decrease in pH leads to the unbiased co-precipitation of APols with 
proteins, including globular hydrophilic proteins. We demonstrated that this 
precipitation is a combined effect of acid precipitation and the APols' protein 
interactions. Also, we have been able to demonstrate that APols-aided protein 
precipitation works well on diluted samples, such as secretome sample, and 
provides a rapid method for protein concentration.

Bioinformatic analysis can not only accelerate drug target identification and 
drug candidate screening and refinement, but also facilitate characterization of 
side effects and predict drug resistance. High-throughput data such as genomic, 
epigenetic, genome architecture, cistromic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and 
ribosome profiling data have all made significant contribution to mechanismbased 
drug discovery and drug repurposing. Accumulation of protein and RNA structures, 
as well as development of homology modeling and protein structure simulation, 
coupled with large structure databases of small molecules and metabolites, paved 
the way for more realistic protein-ligand docking experiments and more 
informative virtual screening. I present the conceptual framework that drives 
the collection of these high-throughput data, summarize the utility and 
potential of mining these data in drug discovery, outline a few inherent 
limitations in data and software mining these data, point out news ways to 
refine analysis of these diverse types of data, and highlight commonly used 
software and databases relevant to drug discovery.

Complex stability and dynamic subunit interchange modulates the disparate 
activities of the yeast moonlighting proteins Hal3 and Vhs3.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hal3 and Vhs3 are moonlighting proteins, acting both as 
inhibitors of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase Ppz1 and as subunits 
(together with Cab3) of the unique heterotrimeric phosphopantothenoylcysteine 
decarboxylase (PPCDC) enzyme of Hemiascomycetous yeast. Both these roles are 
essential: PPCDC catalyses the third step of coenzyme A biosynthesis, while Ppz1 
inhibition is required for regulation of monovalent cation homeostasis. However, 
the mechanisms by which these proteins' disparate activities are regulated are 
not well understood. The PPCDC domains (PDs) of Hal3, Vhs3 and Cab3 constitute 
the minimum requirement for these proteins to show both PPCDC activity and, in 
the case of Hal3 and Vhs3, to bind to Ppz1. Using these PD proteins as a model 
system to study the possibility of dynamic interchange between these roles, we 
provide evidence that Hal3 binds Ppz1 as a monomer (1:1 stoichiometry), 
requiring it to de-oligomerize from its usual homo- and heterotrimeric states 
(the latter having PPCDC activity). This de-oligomerization is made possible by 
structural features that set Hal3 apart from Vhs3, increasing its ability to 
undergo monomer exchange. These findings suggest that oligomer interchange may 
be a significant factor in the functional regulation of these proteins and their 
various unrelated (moonlighting) functions.

Chaperones are protein complexes that help to fold and disaggregate a cell's 
proteins. It is not understood how four major chaperone systems of Escherichia 
coli work together in proteostasis: the recognition, sorting, folding, and 
disaggregating of the cell's many different proteins. Here, we model this 
machine. We combine extensive data on chaperoning, folding, and aggregation 
rates with expression levels of proteins and chaperones measured at different 
growth rates. We find that the proteostasis machine recognizes and sorts a 
client protein based on two biophysical properties of the client's misfolded 
state (M state): its stability and its kinetic accessibility from its unfolded 
state (U state). The machine is energy-efficient (the sickest proteins use the 
most ATP-expensive chaperones), comprehensive (it can handle any type of 
protein), and economical (the chaperone concentrations are just high enough to 
keep the whole proteome folded and disaggregated but no higher). The cell needs 
higher chaperone levels in two situations: fast growth (when protein production 
rates are high) and very slow growth (to mitigate the effects of protein 
degradation). This type of model complements experimental knowledge by showing 
how the various chaperones work together to achieve the broad folding and 
disaggregation needs of the cell.

BACKGROUND: Kinases and phosphatases (KP) form complex self-regulating networks 
essential for cellular signal processing. In spite of having a wealth of data 
about interactions among KPs and their substrates, we have very limited models 
of the structures of the directed networks they form and consequently our 
ability to formulate hypotheses about how their structure determines the flow of 
information in these networks is restricted.
RESULTS: We assembled and studied the largest bona fide kinase-phosphatase 
network (KP-Net) known to date for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
Application of the vertex sort (VS) algorithm on the KP-Net allowed us to 
elucidate its hierarchical structure in which nodes are sorted into top, core 
and bottom layers, forming a bow tie structure with a strongly connected core 
layer. Surprisingly, phosphatases tend to sort into the top layer, implying they 
are less regulated by phosphorylation than kinases. Superposition of the widest 
range of KP biological properties over the KP-Net hierarchy shows that core 
layer KPs: (i), receive the largest number of inputs; (ii), form bottlenecks 
implicated in multiple pathways and in decision-making; (iii), and are among the 
most regulated KPs both temporally and spatially. Moreover, top layer KPs are 
more abundant and less noisy than those in the bottom layer. Finally, we showed 
that the VS algorithm depends on node degrees without biasing the biological 
results of the sorted network. The VS algorithm is available as an R package ( 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VertexSort/index.html ).
CONCLUSIONS: The KP-Net model we propose possesses a bow tie hierarchical 
structure in which the top layer appears to ensure highest fidelity and the core 
layer appears to mediate signal integration and cell state-dependent signal 
interpretation. Our model of the yeast KP-Net provides both functional insight 
into its organization as we understand today and a framework for future 
investigation of information processing in yeast and eukaryotes in general.

PARP enzymes transfer ADP-ribose from NAD+ onto proteins as a covalent 
modification that regulates multiple aspects of cell biology. Here, we identify 
an undiscovered catalytic activity for human PARP1: de novo generation of free 
PAR molecules that are not attached to proteins. Free PAR production arises when 
a molecule of NAD+ or ADP-ribose docks in the PARP1 acceptor site and attaches 
to an NAD+ molecule bound to the donor site, releasing nicotinamide and 
initiating ADP-ribose chains that emanate from NAD+/ADP-ribose rather than 
protein. Free PAR is also produced by human PARP2 and the PARP enzyme Tankyrase. 
We demonstrate that free PAR in cells is generated mostly by PARP1 de novo 
synthesis activity rather than by PAR-degrading enzymes PAR glycohydrolase 
(PARG), ARH3, and TARG1 releasing PAR from protein. The coincident production of 
free PAR and protein-linked modifications alters models for PAR signaling and 
broadens the scope of PARP enzyme signaling capacity.

In living cells, functional protein-protein interactions compete with a much 
larger number of nonfunctional, or promiscuous, interactions. Several cellular 
properties contribute to avoiding unwanted protein interactions, including 
regulation of gene expression, cellular compartmentalization, and high 
specificity and affinity of functional interactions. Here we investigate whether 
other mechanisms exist that shape the sequence and structure of proteins to 
favor their correct assembly into functional protein complexes. To examine this 
question, we project evolutionary and cellular abundance information onto 397, 
196, and 631 proteins of known 3D structure from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, and Homo sapiens, respectively. On the basis of amino acid 
frequencies in interface patches versus the solvent-accessible protein surface, 
we define a propensity or "stickiness" scale for each of the 20 amino acids. We 
find that the propensity to interact in a nonspecific manner is inversely 
correlated with abundance. In other words, high abundance proteins have less 
sticky surfaces. We also find that stickiness constrains protein evolution, 
whereby residues in sticky surface patches are more conserved than those found 
in nonsticky patches. Finally, we find that the constraint imposed by stickiness 
on protein divergence is proportional to protein abundance, which provides 
mechanistic insights into the correlation between protein conservation and 
protein abundance. Overall, the avoidance of nonfunctional interactions 
significantly influences the physico-chemical and evolutionary properties of 
proteins. Remarkably, the effects observed are consistently larger in E. coli 
and S. cerevisiae than in H. sapiens, suggesting that promiscuous 
protein-protein interactions may be freer to accumulate in the human lineage.

Contrary to the textbook portrayal of glycolysis as a single pathway conserved 
across all domains of life, not all sugar-consuming organisms use the canonical 
Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnass (EMP) glycolytic pathway. Prokaryotic glucose 
metabolism is particularly diverse, including several alternative glycolytic 
pathways, the most common of which is the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. The 
prevalence of the ED pathway is puzzling as it produces only one ATP per 
glucose--half as much as the EMP pathway. We argue that the diversity of 
prokaryotic glucose metabolism may reflect a tradeoff between a pathway's energy 
(ATP) yield and the amount of enzymatic protein required to catalyze pathway 
flux. We introduce methods for analyzing pathways in terms of thermodynamics and 
kinetics and show that the ED pathway is expected to require several-fold less 
enzymatic protein to achieve the same glucose conversion rate as the EMP 
pathway. Through genomic analysis, we further show that prokaryotes use 
different glycolytic pathways depending on their energy supply. Specifically, 
energy-deprived anaerobes overwhelmingly rely upon the higher ATP yield of the 
EMP pathway, whereas the ED pathway is common among facultative anaerobes and 
even more common among aerobes. In addition to demonstrating how protein costs 
can explain the use of alternative metabolic strategies, this study illustrates 
a direct connection between an organism's environment and the thermodynamic and 
biochemical properties of the metabolic pathways it employs.

Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form 
stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope 
membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants 
tic56-1 and ppi2 (toc159) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow 
heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive 
quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with 
GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional defect in the accumulation of 
plastid ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of plastid encoded 
proteins. In the tic56-1 mutant, the assembly of functional ribosomes is 
furthermore hampered by a processing defect of the plastid 23S rRNA. 
Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype 
of plastid proteome accumulation in tic56-1 and to a smaller degree also ppi2 
plastids, suggesting that a defect in plastid translation is largely responsible 
for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the tic56-3 
mutant revealed no significant defect in the import of small ribosomal protein 
16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the defect in ribosome 
assembly in tic56-1 may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. 
Our data establish a previously unknown link between plastid protein import, the 
processing of plastid rRNAs, and the assembly of plastid ribosomes and provide 
further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular 
basis for their albino phenotype.

The protein α -synuclein is considered central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson 
disease (PD) on genetic and histopathological grounds. It is widely expressed in 
fetal life and continues to be highly expressed in adult neural tissues, red 
blood cells and platelets, while the remainder of adult tissues are reported to 
have little or no expression. Despite cellular and molecular evidence for a role 
in neuronal function including synaptic vesicle trafficking, neurotransmitter 
release, mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, neurogenesis, 
neuroprotection, and neuromelanin biosynthesis, mice ablated for the gene 
encoding α -synuclein (Snca) have little or no neurological phenotype. Thus, 
nearly 20 years of intensive study have yet to reveal conclusively what the 
normal function of this highly abundant protein is in the nervous system. 
Interestingly, α -synuclein has also been shown to have enzymatic activity as a 
ferrireductase capable of reducing Fe+3 to Fe+2. Given its abundant expression 
in red blood cells, we set out to explore the role of α -synuclein in converting 
chemically-induced Fe+3 methemoglobin to normal Fe+2 hemoglobin. Initial in vivo 
experiments with the potent methemoglobin inducer, para-aminopropiophenone and 
its active metabolite, 4-hydroxy para-aminopropiophenone, demonstrated 
significantly greater and more prolonged methemoglobinemia in Snca-/- mice 
compared to Snca+/+ mice. In vitro experiments with red blood cells, however, 
and in vivo experiments in genetically engineered mouse strains that differ in 
their α -synuclein expression in various tissues, including the nervous system, 
red blood cells and liver, revealed that contrary to the initial hypothesis, a 
lack of expression of α -synuclein in red blood cells did not correlate with 
higher levels or more prolonged duration of methemoglobinemia. Instead, the 
greater sensitivity to chemically induced methemoglobinemia correlated with the 
absence of hepatic α -synuclein expression. We have uncovered a new and robust 
whole-animal phenotype in mice lacking α -synuclein that reflects its hitherto 
unrecognized role in xenobiotic detoxification.

Cells require energy for growth and maintenance and have evolved to have 
multiple pathways to produce energy in response to varying conditions. A basic 
question in this context is how cells organize energy metabolism, which is, 
however, challenging to elucidate due to its complexity, i.e., the 
energy-producing pathways overlap with each other and even intertwine with 
biomass formation pathways. Here, we propose a modeling concept that decomposes 
energy metabolism into biomass formation and ATP-producing pathways. The latter 
can be further decomposed into a high-yield and a low-yield pathway. This 
enables independent estimation of protein efficiency for each pathway. With this 
concept, we modeled energy metabolism for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae and found that the high-yield pathway shows lower protein efficiency 
than the low-yield pathway. Taken together with a fixed protein constraint, we 
predict overflow metabolism in E. coli and the Crabtree effect in S. cerevisiae, 
meaning that energy metabolism is sufficient to explain the metabolic switches. 
The static protein constraint is supported by the findings that protein mass of 
energy metabolism is conserved across conditions based on absolute proteomics 
data. This also suggests that enzymes may have decreased saturation or activity 
at low glucose uptake rates. Finally, our analyses point out three ways to 
improve growth, i.e., increasing protein allocation to energy metabolism, 
decreasing ATP demand, or increasing activity for key enzymes.

Structural basis for the MukB-topoisomerase IV interaction and its functional 
implications in vivo.

Chromosome partitioning in Escherichia coli is assisted by two interacting 
proteins, topoisomerase (topo) IV and MukB. MukB stimulates the relaxation of 
negative supercoils by topo IV; to understand the mechanism of their action and 
to define this functional interplay, we determined the crystal structure of a 
minimal MukB-topo IV complex to 2.3 Å resolution. The structure shows that the 
so-called 'hinge' region of MukB forms a heterotetrameric assembly with a 
C-terminal DNA binding domain (CTD) on topo IV's ParC subunit. Biochemical 
studies show that the hinge stimulates topo IV by competing for a site on the 
CTD that normally represses activity on negatively supercoiled DNA, while 
complementation tests using mutants implicated in the interaction reveal that 
the cellular dependency on topo IV derives from a joint need for both strand 
passage and MukB binding. Interestingly, the configuration of the MukB·topo IV 
complex sterically disfavours intradimeric interactions, indicating that the 
proteins may form oligomeric arrays with one another, and suggesting a framework 
by which MukB and topo IV may collaborate during daughter chromosome 
disentanglement.

Proteomes are characterized by large protein-abundance differences, cell-type- 
and time-dependent expression patterns and post-translational modifications, all 
of which carry biological information that is not accessible by genomics or 
transcriptomics. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based draft of the human 
proteome and a public, high-performance, in-memory database for real-time 
analysis of terabytes of big data, called ProteomicsDB. The information 
assembled from human tissues, cell lines and body fluids enabled estimation of 
the size of the protein-coding genome, and identified organ-specific proteins 
and a large number of translated lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs). 
Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues 
revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of 
drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting 
resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise 
for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes. 
ProteomicsDB thus enables navigation of proteomes, provides biological insight 
and fosters the development of proteomic technology.

When telomeres become critically short, DNA damage response factors are 
recruited at chromosome ends, initiating a cellular response to DNA damage. We 
performed proteomic isolation of chromatin fragments (PICh) in order to define 
changes in chromatin composition that occur upon onset of acute telomere 
dysfunction triggered by depletion of the telomere-associated factor TRF2. This 
unbiased purification of telomere-associated proteins in functional or 
dysfunctional conditions revealed the dynamic changes in chromatin composition 
that take place at telomeres upon DNA damage induction. On the basis of our 
results, we describe a critical role for the polycomb group protein Ring1b in 
nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated end-to-end chromosome fusions. We show 
that cells with reduced levels of Ring1b have a reduced ability to repair 
uncapped telomeric chromatin. Our data represent an unbiased isolation of 
chromatin undergoing DNA damage and are a valuable resource to map the changes 
in chromatin composition in response to DNA damage activation.

Osteoporosis is caused by decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and new 
treatments for this disease are desperately needed. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 
(BMP2) is crucial for bone formation. The mimetic peptide CK2.3 acts downstream 
of BMP2 and increases BMD when injected systemically into the tail vein of mice. 
However, the most effective dosage needed to induce BMD in humans is unknown. We 
developed a mathematical model for CK2.3-dependent bone mineralization. We used 
a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to derive the CK2.3 
concentration needed to increase BMD. Based on our results, the ideal dose of 
CK2.3 for a healthy individual to achieve the maximum increase of mineralization 
was about 409 µM injected in 500 µL volume, while dosage for osteoporosis 
patients was about 990 µM. This model showed that CK2.3 could increase the 
average area of bone mineralization in patients and in healthy adults.

In this study, we originally aimed to characterize the potential role of 
Argonaute 2 (AGO2) in the nucleus, a key protein of the miRNA machinery. We 
combined Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with high throughput sequencing 
(ChIP-seq) and quantitative mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS) using the broadly used 
AGO2 11A9 antibody to determine interactions with chromatin and nuclear 
proteins. We found a previously described interaction between AGO2 and SWI/SNF 
on chromatin with ChIP-MS and observed enrichment at enhancers and transcription 
start sites using ChIP-seq. However, antibody specificity issues can produce 
misleading results for ChIP, RNA-seq and Mass spectrometry. Therefore, we 
developed a CRISPR/Cas9 engineered AGO2-/- HEK293T cell line to validate our 
findings. ChIP-qPCR and immunoprecipitation combined with MS (IP-MS) showed that 
the 11A9 antibody associates with chromatin and SWI/SNF in the absence of AGO2. 
Furthermore, stoichiometry, IP-MS and co-IP analysis suggests a direct 
interaction of this antibody with SMARCC1, a component of the SWI/SNF complex. 
For this reason, particular care should be taken in performing and interpreting 
experiments in which the 11A9 antibody is used to study a nuclear role of AGO2.

The self-association of proteins into symmetric complexes is ubiquitous in all 
kingdoms of life. Symmetric complexes possess unique geometric and functional 
properties, but their internal symmetry can pose a risk. In sickle-cell disease, 
the symmetry of haemoglobin exacerbates the effect of a mutation, triggering 
assembly into harmful fibrils. Here we examine the universality of this 
mechanism and its relation to protein structure geometry. We introduced point 
mutations solely designed to increase surface hydrophobicity among 12 distinct 
symmetric complexes from Escherichia coli. Notably, all responded by forming 
supramolecular assemblies in vitro, as well as in vivo upon heterologous 
expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Remarkably, in four cases, 
micrometre-long fibrils formed in vivo in response to a single point mutation. 
Biophysical measurements and electron microscopy revealed that mutants 
self-assembled in their folded states and so were not amyloid-like. Structural 
examination of 73 mutants identified supramolecular assembly hot spots 
predictable by geometry. A subsequent structural analysis of 7,471 symmetric 
complexes showed that geometric hot spots were buffered chemically by 
hydrophilic residues, suggesting a mechanism preventing mis-assembly of these 
regions. Thus, point mutations can frequently trigger folded proteins to 
self-assemble into higher-order structures. This potential is counterbalanced by 
negative selection and can be exploited to design nanomaterials in living cells.

In a global effort for scientific transparency, it has become feasible and good 
practice to share experimental data supporting novel findings. Consequently, the 
amount of publicly available MS-based proteomics data has grown substantially in 
recent years. With some notable exceptions, this extensive material has however 
largely been left untouched. The time has now come for the proteomics community 
to utilize this potential gold mine for new discoveries, and uncover its 
untapped potential. In this review, we provide a brief history of the sharing of 
proteomics data, showing ways in which publicly available proteomics data are 
already being (re-)used, and outline potential future opportunities based on 
four different usage types: use, reuse, reprocess, and repurpose. We thus aim to 
assist the proteomics community in stepping up to the challenge, and to make the 
most of the rapidly increasing amount of public proteomics data.

ProteomicsDB (https://www.ProteomicsDB.org) is a protein-centric in-memory 
database for the exploration of large collections of quantitative mass 
spectrometry-based proteomics data. ProteomicsDB was first released in 2014 to 
enable the interactive exploration of the first draft of the human proteome. To 
date, it contains quantitative data from 78 projects totalling over 19k LC-MS/MS 
experiments. A standardized analysis pipeline enables comparisons between 
multiple datasets to facilitate the exploration of protein expression across 
hundreds of tissues, body fluids and cell lines. We recently extended the data 
model to enable the storage and integrated visualization of other quantitative 
omics data. This includes transcriptomics data from e.g. NCBI GEO, 
protein-protein interaction information from STRING, functional annotations from 
KEGG, drug-sensitivity/selectivity data from several public sources and 
reference mass spectra from the ProteomeTools project. The extended 
functionality transforms ProteomicsDB into a multi-purpose resource connecting 
quantification and meta-data for each protein. The rich user interface helps 
researchers to navigate all data sources in either a protein-centric or 
multi-protein-centric manner. Several options are available to download data 
manually, while our application programming interface enables accessing 
quantitative data systematically.

Mass spectrometry, in the past five years, has increased in speed, accuracy and 
use. With the ability of the mass spectrometers to identify increasing numbers 
of proteins the identification of undesirable peptides (those not from the 
protein sample) has also increased. Most undesirable contaminants originate in 
the laboratory and come from either the user (e.g. keratin from hair and skin), 
or from reagents (e.g. trypsin), that are required to prepare samples for 
analysis. We found that a significant amount of MS instrument time was spent 
sequencing peptides from abundant contaminant proteins. While completely 
eliminating non-specific protein contamination is not feasible, it is possible 
to reduce the sequencing of these contaminants. For example, exclusion lists can 
provide a list of masses that can be used to instruct the mass spectrometer to 
'ignore' the undesired contaminant peptides in the list. We empirically 
generated be-spoke exclusion lists for several model organisms (Homo sapiens, 
Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis), utilising 
information from over 500 mass spectrometry runs and cumulative analysis of 
these data. Here we show that by employing these empirically generated lists, it 
was possible to reduce the time spent analysing contaminating peptides in a 
given sample thereby facilitating more efficient data acquisition and analysis.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Given the current efficacy of the Mass Spectrometry 
instrumentation, the utilisation of data from ~500 mass spec runs to generate 
be-spoke exclusion lists and optimise data acquisition is the significance of 
this manuscript.

The mechanisms by which RNA-binding proteins control the translation of subsets 
of mRNAs are not yet clear. Slf1p and Sro9p are atypical-La motif containing 
proteins which are members of a superfamily of RNA-binding proteins conserved in 
eukaryotes. RIP-Seq analysis of these two yeast proteins identified overlapping 
and distinct sets of mRNA targets, including highly translated mRNAs such as 
those encoding ribosomal proteins. In paralell, transcriptome analysis of slf1Δ 
and sro9Δ mutant strains indicated altered gene expression in similar functional 
classes of mRNAs following loss of each factor. The loss of SLF1 had a greater 
impact on the transcriptome, and in particular, revealed changes in genes 
involved in the oxidative stress response. slf1Δ cells are more sensitive to 
oxidants and RIP-Seq analysis of oxidatively stressed cells enriched Slf1p 
targets encoding antioxidants and other proteins required for oxidant tolerance. 
To quantify these effects at the protein level, we used label-free mass 
spectrometry to compare the proteomes of wild-type and slf1Δ strains following 
oxidative stress. This analysis identified several proteins which are normally 
induced in response to hydrogen peroxide, but where this increase is attenuated 
in the slf1Δ mutant. Importantly, a significant number of the mRNAs encoding 
these targets were also identified as Slf1p-mRNA targets. We show that Slf1p 
remains associated with the few translating ribosomes following hydrogen 
peroxide stress and that Slf1p co-immunoprecipitates ribosomes and members of 
the eIF4E/eIF4G/Pab1p 'closed loop' complex suggesting that Slf1p interacts with 
actively translated mRNAs following stress. Finally, mutational analysis of SLF1 
revealed a novel ribosome interacting domain in Slf1p, independent of its RNA 
binding La-motif. Together, our results indicate that Slf1p mediates a 
translational response to oxidative stress via mRNA-specific translational 
control.

Measuring changes in protein or organelle abundance in the cell is an essential, 
but challenging aspect of cell biology. Frequently-used methods for determining 
organelle abundance typically rely on detection of a very few marker proteins, 
so are unsatisfactory. In silico estimates of protein abundances from publicly 
available protein spectra can provide useful standard abundance values but 
contain only data from tissue proteomes, and are not coupled to organelle 
localization data. A new protein abundance score, the normalized protein 
abundance scale (NPAS), expands on the number of scored proteins and the scoring 
accuracy of lower-abundance proteins in Arabidopsis. NPAS was combined with 
subcellular protein localization data, facilitating quantitative estimations of 
organelle abundance during routine experimental procedures. A suite of targeted 
proteomics markers for subcellular compartment markers was developed, enabling 
independent verification of in silico estimates for relative organelle 
abundance. Estimation of relative organelle abundance was found to be 
reproducible and consistent over a range of tissues and growth conditions. In 
silico abundance estimations and localization data have been combined into an 
online tool, multiple marker abundance profiling, available in the SUBA4 toolbox 
(http://suba.live).

The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) database at 
the European Bioinformatics Institute is one of the most prominent data 
repositories of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data. Here, we summarize 
recent developments in the PRIDE database and related tools. First, we provide 
up-to-date statistics in data content, splitting the figures by groups of 
organisms and species, including peptide and protein identifications, and 
post-translational modifications. We then describe the tools that are part of 
the PRIDE submission pipeline, especially the recently developed PRIDE Converter 
2 (new submission tool) and PRIDE Inspector (visualization and analysis tool). 
We also give an update about the integration of PRIDE with other MS proteomics 
resources in the context of the ProteomeXchange consortium. Finally, we briefly 
review the quality control efforts that are ongoing at present and outline our 
future plans.

GeneCards is a one-stop shop for searchable human gene annotations 
(http://www.genecards.org/). Data are automatically mined from ∼120 sources and 
presented in an integrated web card for every human gene. We report the 
application of recent advances in proteomics to enhance gene annotation and 
classification in GeneCards. First, we constructed the Human Integrated Protein 
Expression Database (HIPED), a unified database of protein abundance in human 
tissues, based on the publically available mass spectrometry (MS)-based 
proteomics sources ProteomicsDB, Multi-Omics Profiling Expression Database, 
Protein Abundance Across Organisms and The MaxQuant DataBase. The integrated 
database, residing within GeneCards, compares favourably with its individual 
sources, covering nearly 90% of human protein-coding genes. For gene annotation 
and comparisons, we first defined a protein expression vector for each gene, 
based on normalized abundances in 69 normal human tissues. This vector is 
portrayed in the GeneCards expression section as a bar graph, allowing visual 
inspection and comparison. These data are juxtaposed with transcriptome bar 
graphs. Using the protein expression vectors, we further defined a pairwise 
metric that helps assess expression-based pairwise proximity. This new metric 
for finding functional partners complements eight others, including sharing of 
pathways, gene ontology (GO) terms and domains, implemented in the GeneCards 
Suite. In parallel, we calculated proteome-based differential expression, 
highlighting a subset of tissues that overexpress a gene and subserving gene 
classification. This textual annotation allows users of VarElect, the suite's 
next-generation phenotyper, to more effectively discover causative disease 
variants. Finally, we define the protein-RNA expression ratio and correlation as 
yet another attribute of every gene in each tissue, adding further annotative 
information. The results constitute a significant enhancement of several 
GeneCards sections and help promote and organize the genome-wide structural and 
functional knowledge of the human proteome. Database

α,β-unsaturated carbonyls interfere with numerous plant physiological processes. 
One mechanism of action is their reactivity toward thiols of metabolites like 
cysteine and glutathione (GSH). This work aimed at better understanding these 
interactions. Both 12-oxophytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) and abscisic acid (ABA) 
conjugated with cysteine. It was found that the reactivity of α,β-unsaturated 
carbonyls with GSH followed the sequence trans-2-hexenal < 12-OPDA ≈ 
12-OPDA-ethylester < 2-cyclopentenone << methyl vinylketone (MVK). 
Interestingly, GSH, but not ascorbate (vitamin C), supplementation ameliorated 
the phytotoxic potential of MVK. In addition, 12-OPDA and 12-OPDA-related 
conjugated carbonyl compounds interacted with proteins, e.g., with members of 
the thioredoxin (TRX)-fold family. 12-OPDA modified two cysteinyl residues of 
chloroplast TRX-f1. The OPDAylated TRX-f1 lost its activity to activate the 
Calvin-Benson-cycle enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). Finally, we 
show that 12-OPDA interacts with cyclophilin 20-3 (Cyp20-3) non-covalently and 
affects its peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans isomerase activity. The results 
demonstrate the high potential of 12-OPDA as a diverse interactor and cellular 
regulator and suggest that OPDAylation may occur in plant cells and should be 
investigated as novel regulatory mechanism.

Translation initiation factor eIF4E mediates mRNA selection for protein 
synthesis via the mRNA 5'cap. A family of binding proteins, termed the 4E-BPs, 
interact with eIF4E to hinder ribosome recruitment. Mechanisms underlying mRNA 
specificity for 4E-BP control remain poorly understood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
4E-BPs, Caf20p and Eap1p, each regulate an overlapping set of mRNAs. We 
undertook global approaches to identify protein and RNA partners of both 4E-BPs 
by immunoprecipitation of tagged proteins combined with mass spectrometry or 
next-generation sequencing. Unexpectedly, mass spectrometry indicated that the 
4E-BPs associate with many ribosomal proteins. 80S ribosome and polysome 
association was independently confirmed and was not dependent upon interaction 
with eIF4E, as mutated forms of both Caf20p and Eap1p with disrupted 
eIF4E-binding motifs retain ribosome interaction. Whole-cell proteomics revealed 
Caf20p mutations cause both up and down-regulation of proteins and that many 
changes were independent of the 4E-binding motif. Investigations into Caf20p 
mRNA targets by immunoprecipitation followed by RNA sequencing revealed a strong 
association between Caf20p and mRNAs involved in transcription and cell cycle 
processes, consistent with observed cell cycle phenotypes of mutant strains. A 
core set of over 500 Caf20p-interacting mRNAs comprised of both eIF4E-dependent 
(75%) and eIF4E-independent targets (25%), which differ in sequence attributes. 
eIF4E-independent mRNAs share a 3' UTR motif. Caf20p binds all tested 
motif-containing 3' UTRs. Caf20p and the 3'UTR combine to influence ERS1 mRNA 
polysome association consistent with Caf20p contributing to translational 
control. Finally ERS1 3'UTR confers Caf20-dependent repression of expression to 
a heterologous reporter gene. Taken together, these data reveal conserved 
features of eIF4E-dependent Caf20p mRNA targets and uncover a novel 
eIF4E-independent mode of Caf20p binding to mRNAs that extends the regulatory 
role of Caf20p in the mRNA-specific repression of protein synthesis beyond its 
interaction with eIF4E.

BACKGROUND: The exchange of metabolites and the reprogramming of metabolism in 
response to shifting microenvironmental conditions can drive subpopulations of 
cells within colonies toward divergent behaviors. Understanding the interactions 
of these subpopulations-their potential for competition as well as 
cooperation-requires both a metabolic model capable of accounting for a wide 
range of environmental conditions, and a detailed dynamic description of the 
cells' shared extracellular space.
RESULTS: Here we show that a cell's position within an in silico Escherichia 
coli colony grown on glucose minimal agar can drastically affect its metabolism: 
"pioneer" cells at the outer edge engage in rapid growth that expands the 
colony, while dormant cells in the interior separate two spatially distinct 
subpopulations linked by a cooperative form of acetate crossfeeding that has so 
far gone unnoticed. Our hybrid simulation technique integrates 3D 
reaction-diffusion modeling with genome-scale flux balance analysis (FBA) to 
describe the position-dependent metabolism and growth of cells within a colony. 
Our results are supported by imaging experiments involving strains of 
fluorescently-labeled E. coli. The spatial patterns of fluorescence within these 
experimental colonies identify cells with upregulated genes associated with 
acetate crossfeeding and are in excellent agreement with the predictions. 
Furthermore, the height-to-width ratios of both the experimental and simulated 
colonies are in good agreement over a growth period of 48 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Our modeling paradigm can accurately reproduce a number of known 
features of E. coli colony growth, as well as predict a novel one that had until 
now gone unrecognized. The acetate crossfeeding we see has a direct analogue in 
a form of lactate crossfeeding observed in certain forms of cancer, and we 
anticipate future application of our methodology to models of tissues and 
tumors.

The noncoding genome plays an important role in de novo gene birth and in the 
emergence of genetic novelty. Nevertheless, how noncoding sequences' properties 
could promote the birth of novel genes and shape the evolution and the 
structural diversity of proteins remains unclear. Therefore, by combining 
different bioinformatic approaches, we characterized the fold potential 
diversity of the amino acid sequences encoded by all intergenic open reading 
frames (ORFs) of S. cerevisiae with the aim of (1) exploring whether the 
structural states' diversity of proteomes is already present in noncoding 
sequences, and (2) estimating the potential of the noncoding genome to produce 
novel protein bricks that could either give rise to novel genes or be integrated 
into pre-existing proteins, thus participating in protein structure diversity 
and evolution. We showed that amino acid sequences encoded by most yeast 
intergenic ORFs contain the elementary building blocks of protein structures. 
Moreover, they encompass the large structural state diversity of canonical 
proteins, with the majority predicted as foldable. Then, we investigated the 
early stages of de novo gene birth by reconstructing the ancestral sequences of 
70 yeast de novo genes and characterized the sequence and structural properties 
of intergenic ORFs with a strong translation signal. This enabled us to 
highlight sequence and structural factors determining de novo gene emergence. 
Finally, we showed a strong correlation between the fold potential of de novo 
proteins and one of their ancestral amino acid sequences, reflecting the 
relationship between the noncoding genome and the protein structure universe.

Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have typically been studied 
independently, yet many proteins are modified by more than one PTM type, and 
cell signaling pathways somehow integrate this information. We coupled 
immunoprecipitation using PTM-specific antibodies with tandem mass tag (TMT) 
mass spectrometry to simultaneously examine phosphorylation, methylation, and 
acetylation in 45 lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung tissue and to 
cell lines treated with anticancer drugs. This simultaneous, large-scale, 
integrative analysis of these PTMs using a cluster-filtered network (CFN) 
approach revealed that cell signaling pathways were outlined by clustering 
patterns in PTMs. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding 
(t-SNE) method to identify PTM clusters and then integrated each with known 
protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to elucidate functional cell signaling 
pathways. The CFN identified known and previously unknown cell signaling 
pathways in lung cancer cells that were not present in normal lung epithelial 
tissue. In various proteins modified by more than one type of PTM, the incidence 
of those PTMs exhibited inverse relationships, suggesting that molecular 
exclusive "OR" gates determine a large number of signal transduction events. We 
also showed that the acetyltransferase EP300 appears to be a hub in the network 
of pathways involving different PTMs. In addition, the data shed light on the 
mechanism of action of geldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor. Together, the findings 
reveal that cell signaling pathways mediated by acetylation, methylation, and 
phosphorylation regulate the cytoskeleton, membrane traffic, and RNA binding 
protein-mediated control of gene expression.

We describe a proteomic screening approach based on the concept of sentinel 
proteins, biological markers whose change in abundance characterizes the 
activation state of a given cellular process. Our sentinel assay simultaneously 
probed 188 biological processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to a set of 
environmental perturbations. The approach can be applied to analyze responses to 
large sets of uncharacterized perturbations in high throughput.

The Evolutionary Constraints on Angiosperm Chloroplast Adaptation.

The chloroplast (plastid) arose via the endosymbiosis of a photosynthetic 
cyanobacterium by a nonphotosynthetic eukaryotic cell ∼1.5 billion years ago. 
Although the plastid underwent rapid evolution by genome reduction, its rate of 
molecular evolution is low and its genome organization is highly conserved. 
Here, we investigate the factors that have constrained the rate of molecular 
evolution of protein-coding genes in the plastid genome. Through phylogenomic 
analysis of 773 angiosperm plastid genomes, we show that there is substantial 
variation in the rate of molecular evolution between genes. We demonstrate that 
the distance of a plastid gene from the likely origin of replication influences 
the rate at which it has evolved, consistent with time and distance-dependent 
nucleotide mutation gradients. In addition, we show that the amino acid 
composition of a gene product constraints its substitution tolerance, limiting 
its mutation landscape and its corresponding rate of molecular evolution. 
Finally, we demonstrate that the mRNA abundance of a gene is a key factor in 
determining its rate of molecular evolution, suggesting an interaction between 
transcription and DNA repair in the plastid. Collectively, we show that the 
location, the composition, and the expression of a plastid gene can account for 
>50% of the variation in its rate of molecular evolution. Thus, these three 
factors have exerted a substantial limitation on the capacity for adaptive 
evolution in plastid-encoded genes and ultimately constrained the evolvability 
of the chloroplast.

Cells metabolize nutrients through a complex metabolic and signaling network 
that governs redox homeostasis. At the core of this, redox regulatory network is 
a mutually inhibitory relationship between reduced glutathione and reactive 
oxygen species (ROS)-two opposing metabolites that are linked to upstream 
nutrient metabolic pathways (glucose, cysteine, and glutamine) and downstream 
feedback loops of signaling pathways (calcium and NADPH oxidase). We developed a 
nutrient-redox model of human cells to understand system-level properties of 
this network. Combining in silico modeling and ROS measurements in individual 
cells, we show that ROS dynamics follow a switch-like, all-or-none response upon 
glucose deprivation at a threshold that is approximately two orders of magnitude 
lower than its physiological concentration. We also confirm that this ROS switch 
can be irreversible and exhibits hysteresis, a hallmark of bistability. Our 
findings evidence that bistability modulates redox homeostasis in human cells 
and provide a general framework for quantitative investigations of redox 
regulation in humans.

Beyond their role at nuclear pore complexes, some nucleoporins function in the 
nucleoplasm. One such nucleoporin, Nup98, binds chromatin and regulates gene 
expression. To gain insight into how Nup98 contributes to this process, we 
focused on identifying novel binding partners and understanding the significance 
of these interactions. Here we report on the identification of the DExH/D-box 
helicase DHX9 as an intranuclear Nup98 binding partner. Various results, 
including in vitro assays, show that the FG/GLFG region of Nup98 binds to N- and 
C-terminal regions of DHX9 in an RNA facilitated manner. Importantly, binding of 
Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9, and a transcriptional reporter 
assay suggests Nup98 supports DHX9-stimulated transcription. Consistent with 
these observations, our analysis revealed that Nup98 and DHX9 bind 
interdependently to similar gene loci and their transcripts. Based on our 
results, we propose that Nup98 functions as a co-factor that regulates DHX9 and, 
potentially, other RNA helicases.

Biological rhythms lie at the center of regulatory schemes that control many 
aspects of living systems. At the cellular level, meaningful responses to 
external stimuli depend on propagation and quenching of a signal to maintain 
vigilance for subsequent stimulation or changes that serve to shape and modulate 
the response. The hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad endocrine axis that controls 
reproductive development and function relies on control through rhythmic 
stimulation. Central to this axis is the pulsatile stimulation of the 
gonadotropes by hypothalamic neurons through episodic release of the 
neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Alterations in pulsatile 
stimulation of the gonadotropes result in differential synthesis and secretion 
of the gonadotropins LH and FSH and changes in the expression of their 
respective hormone subunit genes. The requirement to amplify signals arising 
from activation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor and to 
rapidly quench the resultant signal to preserve an adaptive response suggests 
the need for rapid activation and feedback control operating at the level of 
intracellular signaling. Emerging data suggest that reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) can fulfill this role in the GnRH receptor signaling through activation of 
MAP kinase signaling cascades, control of negative feedback, and participation 
in the secretory process. Results obtained in gonadotrope cell lines or other 
cell models indicate that ROS can participate in each of these regulatory 
cascades. We discuss the potential advantage of reactive oxygen signaling for 
modulating the gonadotrope response to GnRH stimulation and the potential 
mechanisms for this action. These observations suggest further targets of study 
for regulation in the gonadotrope.

Protein turnover represents an important mechanism in the functioning of cells, 
with deregulated synthesis and degradation of proteins implicated in many 
diseased states. Therefore, proteomics strategies to measure turnover rates with 
high confidence are of vital importance to understanding many biological 
processes. In this study, the more widely used approach of non-targeted 
precursor ion signal intensity (MS1) quantification is compared with selected 
reaction monitoring (SRM), a data acquisition strategy that records data for 
specific peptides, to determine if improved quantitative data would be obtained 
using a targeted quantification approach. Using mouse liver as a model system, 
turnover measurement of four tricarboxylic acid cycle proteins was performed 
using both MS1 and SRM quantification strategies. SRM outperformed MS1 in terms 
of sensitivity and selectivity of measurement, allowing more confident 
determination of protein turnover rates. SRM data are acquired using cheaper and 
more widely available tandem quadrupole mass spectrometers, making the approach 
accessible to a larger number of researchers than MS1 quantification, which is 
best performed on high mass resolution instruments. SRM acquisition is ideally 
suited to focused studies where the turnover of tens of proteins is measured, 
making it applicable in determining the dynamics of proteins complexes and 
complete metabolic pathways.This article is part of the themed issue 
'Quantitative mass spectrometry'.

Metazoan genomes are copied bidirectionally from thousands of replication 
origins. Replication initiation entails the assembly and activation of two CMG 
helicases (Cdc45⋅Mcm2-7⋅GINS) at each origin. This requires several replication 
firing factors (including TopBP1, RecQL4, and DONSON) whose exact roles are 
still under debate. How two helicases are correctly assembled and activated at 
each origin is a long-standing question. By visualizing the recruitment of GINS, 
Cdc45, TopBP1, RecQL4, and DONSON in real time, we uncovered that replication 
initiation is surprisingly dynamic. First, TopBP1 transiently binds to the 
origin and dissociates before the start of DNA synthesis. Second, two Cdc45 are 
recruited together, even though Cdc45 alone cannot dimerize. Next, two copies of 
DONSON and two GINS simultaneously arrive at the origin, completing the assembly 
of two CMG helicases. Finally, RecQL4 is recruited to the CMG⋅DONSON⋅DONSON⋅CMG 
complex and promotes DONSON dissociation and CMG activation via its ATPase 
activity.

J-proteins, obligate co-chaperones, provide specialization for Hsp70 function in 
a variety of cellular processes. Two of the 13 J-proteins of the yeast 
cytosol/nucleus, Zuo1 and Jjj1, are associated with 60S ribosomal subunits. 
Abundant Zuo1 facilitates folding of nascent polypeptides; Jjj1, of much lower 
abundance, functions in ribosome biogenesis. However, overexpression of Jjj1 
substantially rescues growth defects of cells lacking Zuo1. We analyzed a region 
held in common by Zuo1 and Jjj1, outside the signature J-domain found in all 
J-proteins. This shared "zuotin homology domain" (ZHD) is important for ribosome 
association of both proteins. An N-terminal segment of Jjj1, containing the 
J-domain and ZHD, is ribosome-associated and, like full-length Jjj1, is 
competent to rescue both the cold- and cation-sensitivity of ∆zuo1. However, 
this fragment, when expressed at normal levels, cannot rescue the cytosolic 
ribosome biogenesis defect of ∆jjj1. Our results are consistent with a model in 
which the primary functions of Zuo1 and Jjj1 occur in the cytosol. In addition, 
our data suggest that Zuo1 and Jjj1 bind overlapping sites on ribosomes due to 
an interaction via their common ZHDs, but Jjj1 binds primarily to pre-60S 
particles and Zuo1 to mature subunits. We hypothesize that ZUO1 and JJJ1, which 
are conserved throughout eukaryotes, arose from an ancient duplication of a 
progenitor J-protein gene that encoded the ZHD ribosome-binding region; 
subsequently, specialized roles and additional ribosome interaction sites 
evolved.

BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances in the investigation of myeloproliferative 
neoplasms (MPN), the impact of genetic heterogeneity on its molecular 
pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Thus, in this study, we aim to 
characterize the genetic complexity in Korean patients with polycythemia vera 
(PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET).
METHODS: We conducted association studies using 84 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 229 patients (96 with PV and 133 with ET) and 170 
controls. Further, whole-genome sequencing was performed in six patients (two 
with JAK2 V617F and four with wild-type JAK2), and putative somatic mutations 
were validated in a further 69 ET patients. Clinical and laboratory 
characteristics were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Several germline SNPs and the 46 haplotype were significantly 
associated with PV and ET. Three somatic mutations in MPDZ, IQCH, and CALR genes 
were selected and validated. The frequency of the CALR mutation was 58.0% 
(40/69) in ET patients, who did not carry JAK2/MPL mutations. Moreover, compared 
with JAK2 V617F-positive patients, those with CALR mutations showed lower 
hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (P = 0.004 and P = 0.002, respectively), higher 
platelet counts (P =0.008), and a lower frequency of cytoreductive therapy (P = 
0.014).
CONCLUSION: This study was the first comprehensive investigation of the genetic 
characteristics of Korean patients with PV and ET. We found that somatic 
mutations and the 46 haplotype contribute to PV and ET pathogenesis in Korean 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Pervasive translation is a widespread phenomenon that plays a 
critical role in the emergence of novel microproteins, but the diversity of 
translation patterns contributing to their generation remains unclear. Based on 
54 ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) datasets, we investigated the yeast Ribo-Seq 
landscape using a representation framework that allows the comprehensive 
inventory and classification of the entire diversity of Ribo-Seq signals, 
including non-canonical ones.
RESULTS: We show that if coding regions occupy specific areas of the Ribo-Seq 
landscape, noncoding regions encompass a wide diversity of Ribo-Seq signals and, 
conversely, populate the entire landscape. Our results show that pervasive 
translation can, nevertheless, be associated with high specificity, with 1055 
noncoding ORFs exhibiting canonical Ribo-Seq signals. Using mass spectrometry 
under standard conditions or proteasome inhibition with an in-house analysis 
protocol, we report 239 microproteins originating from noncoding ORFs that 
display canonical but also non-canonical Ribo-Seq signals. Each condition yields 
dozens of additional microprotein candidates with comparable translation 
properties, suggesting a larger population of volatile microproteins that are 
challenging to detect. Our findings suggest that non-canonical translation 
signals may harbor valuable information and underscore the significance of 
considering them in proteogenomic studies. Finally, we show that the translation 
outcome of a noncoding ORF is primarily determined by the initiating codon and 
the codon distribution in its two alternative frames, rather than features 
indicative of functionality.
CONCLUSION: Our results enable us to propose a topology of a species' Ribo-Seq 
landscape, opening the way to comparative analyses of this translation landscape 
under different conditions.

The wealth of high-throughput data has opened up new opportunities to analyze 
and describe biological processes at higher resolution, ultimately leading to a 
significant acceleration of scientific output using high-throughput data from 
the different omics layers and the generation of databases to store and report 
raw datasets. The great variability among the techniques and the heterogeneous 
methodologies used to produce this data have placed meta-analysis methods as one 
of the approaches of choice to correlate the resultant large-scale datasets from 
different research groups. Through multi-study meta-analyses, it is possible to 
generate results with greater statistical power compared to individual analyses. 
Gene signatures, biomarkers and pathways that provide new insights of a 
phenotype of interest have been identified by the analysis of large-scale 
datasets in several fields of science. However, despite all the efforts, a 
standardized regulation to report large-scale data and to identify the molecular 
targets and signaling networks is still lacking. Integrative analyses have also 
been introduced as complementation and augmentation for meta-analysis 
methodologies to generate novel hypotheses. Currently, there is no universal 
method established and the different methods available follow different 
purposes. Herein we describe a new unifying, scalable and straightforward 
methodology to meta-analyze different omics outputs, but also to integrate the 
significant outcomes into novel pathways describing biological processes of 
interest. The significance of using proper molecular identifiers is highlighted 
as well as the potential to further correlate molecules from different 
regulatory levels. To show the methodology's potential, a set of transcriptomic 
datasets are meta-analyzed as an example.

Defining protein composition is a key step in understanding the function of both 
healthy and diseased biological systems. There is currently little consensus 
between existing published proteomes in tissues such as the aorta, cartilage and 
organs such as skin. Lack of agreement as to both the number and identity of 
proteins may be due to issues in protein extraction, sensitivity/specificity of 
detection and the use of disparate tissue/cell sources. Here, we developed a 
method combining bioinformatics and systematic review to screen >32M articles 
from the Web of Science for evidence of proteins in healthy human skin. The 
resulting Manchester Proteome ( www.manchesterproteome.manchester.ac.uk ) 
collates existing evidence which characterises 2,948 skin proteins, 437 unique 
to our database and 2011 evidenced by both mass spectrometry and immune-based 
techniques. This approach circumvents the limitations of individual proteomics 
studies and can be applied to other species, organs, cells or disease-states. 
Accurate tissue proteomes will aid development of engineered constructs and 
offer insight into disease treatments by highlighting differences in proteomic 
composition.

Diaryldienone derivatives with accessible β-carbons show strong anti-neoplastic 
properties, related to their ability to make covalent adducts with free thiols 
by Michael addition, and low toxicity in vivo. Accumulation of 
poly-ubiquitylated proteins, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) 
and induction of cell death are universal hallmarks of their activities. These 
compounds have been characterized as inhibitors of isopeptidases, a family of 
cysteine-proteases, which de-conjugate ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins 
from their targets. However, it is unclear whether they can also react with 
additional proteins. In this work, we utilized the biotin-conjugated 
diaryldienone-derivative named 2c, as a bait to purify novel cellular targets of 
these small molecules. Proteomic analyses have unveiled that, in addition to 
isopeptidases, these inhibitors can form stable covalent adducts with different 
intracellular proteins, thus potentially impacting on multiple functions of the 
cells, from cytoskeletal organization to metabolism. These widespread activities 
can explain the ability of diaryldienone derivatives to efficiently trigger 
different cell death pathways.

The rapid evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite to every single drug 
developed against it calls for the urgent identification of new molecular 
targets. Using a stain specific for the detection of intracellular amyloid 
deposits in live cells, we have detected the presence of abundant protein 
aggregates in Plasmodium falciparum blood stages and female gametes cultured in 
vitro, in the blood stages of mice infected by Plasmodium yoelii, and in the 
mosquito stages of the murine malaria species Plasmodium berghei Aggregated 
proteins could not be detected in early rings, the parasite form that starts the 
intraerythrocytic cycle. A proteomics approach was used to pinpoint actual 
aggregating polypeptides in functional P. falciparum blood stages, which 
resulted in the identification of 369 proteins, with roles particularly enriched 
in nuclear import-related processes. Five aggregation-prone short peptides 
selected from this protein pool exhibited different aggregation propensity 
according to Thioflavin-T fluorescence measurements, and were observed to form 
amorphous aggregates and amyloid fibrils in transmission electron microscope 
images. The results presented suggest that generalized protein aggregation might 
have a functional role in malaria parasites. Future antimalarial strategies 
based on the upsetting of the pathogen's proteostasis and therefore affecting 
multiple gene products could represent the entry to new therapeutic approaches.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster 
and is typified by a lingering pain that can last months or years after the 
characteristic herpes zoster rash disappears. It is well known that there are 
risk factors for the development of PHN, such as its association with certain 
HLA alleles. In this study, previous HLA genotyping results were collected and 
subjected to a meta-analysis with increased statistical power. This work shows 
that the alleles HLA-A*33 and HLA-B*44 are significantly enriched in PHN 
patients, while HLA-A*02 and HLA-B*40 are significantly depleted. Prediction of 
the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) peptide affinity for these four HLA variants by 
using one in-house-developed and two existing state-of-the-art major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligand prediction methods reveals that 
there is a great difference in their absolute and relative peptide binding 
repertoires. It was observed that HLA-A*02 displays a high affinity for an 
∼7-fold-higher number of VZV peptides than HLA-B*44. Furthermore, after 
correction for HLA allele-specific limitations, the relative affinity of 
HLA-A*33 and HLA-B*44 for VZV peptides was found to be significantly lower than 
those of HLA-A*02 and HLA-B*40. In addition, HLA peptide affinity calculations 
indicate strong trends for VZV to avoid high-affinity peptides in some of its 
proteins, independent of the studied HLA allele.
IMPORTANCE: Varicella-zoster virus can cause two distinct diseases: chickenpox 
(varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster). Varicella is a common disease in young 
children, while herpes zoster is more frequent in older individuals. A common 
complication of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia, a persistent and 
debilitating pain that can remain months up to years after the resolution of the 
rash. In this study, we show that the relative affinity of HLA variants 
associated with higher postherpetic neuralgia risk for varicella-zoster virus 
peptides is lower than that of variants with a lower risk. These results provide 
new insight into the development of postherpetic neuralgia and strongly support 
the hypothesis that one of its possible underlying causes is a suboptimal 
anti-VZV immune response due to weak HLA binding peptide affinity.

Network complexity is required to lend cellular processes flexibility to respond 
timely to a variety of dynamic signals, while simultaneously warranting 
robustness to protect cellular integrity against perturbations. The cell cycle 
serves as a paradigm for such processes; it maintains its frequency and temporal 
structure (although these may differ among cell types) under the former, but 
accelerates under the latter. Cell cycle molecules act together in time and in 
different cellular compartments to execute cell type-specific programs. 
Strikingly, the timing at which molecular switches occur is controlled by 
abundance and stoichiometry of multiple proteins within complexes. However, 
traditional methods that investigate one effector at a time are insufficient to 
understand how modulation of protein complex dynamics at cell cycle transitions 
shapes responsiveness, yet preserving robustness. To overcome this shortcoming, 
we propose a multidisciplinary approach to gain a systems-level understanding of 
quantitative cell cycle dynamics in mammalian cells from a new perspective. By 
suggesting advanced experimental technologies and dedicated modeling approaches, 
we present innovative strategies (i) to measure absolute protein concentration 
in vivo, and (ii) to determine how protein dosage, e.g., altered protein 
abundance, and spatial (de)regulation may affect timing and robustness of phase 
transitions. We describe a method that we name "Maximum Allowable mammalian 
Trade-Off-Weight" (MAmTOW), which may be realized to determine the upper limit 
of gene copy numbers in mammalian cells. These aspects, not covered by current 
systems biology approaches, are essential requirements to generate precise 
computational models and identify (sub)network-centered nodes underlying a 
plethora of pathological conditions.

Eukaryotic organisms play an important role in industrial biotechnology, from 
the production of fuels and commodity chemicals to therapeutic proteins. To 
optimize these industrial systems, a mathematical approach can be used to 
integrate the description of multiple biological networks into a single model 
for cell analysis and engineering. One of the most accurate models of biological 
systems include Expression and Thermodynamics FLux (ETFL), which efficiently 
integrates RNA and protein synthesis with traditional genome-scale metabolic 
models. However, ETFL is so far only applicable for E. coli. To adapt this model 
for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed yETFL, in which we augmented the 
original formulation with additional considerations for biomass composition, the 
compartmentalized cellular expression system, and the energetic costs of 
biological processes. We demonstrated the ability of yETFL to predict maximum 
growth rate, essential genes, and the phenotype of overflow metabolism. We 
envision that the presented formulation can be extended to a wide range of 
eukaryotic organisms to the benefit of academic and industrial research.

BACKGROUND: For a long time synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were 
considered as silent mutations. However, nowadays it is well known that they can 
affect protein conformation and function, leading to altered disease 
susceptibilities, differential prognosis and/or drug responses, among other 
clinically relevant genetic traits. This occurs through different mechanisms: by 
disrupting the splicing signals of precursor mRNAs, affecting regulatory 
binding-sites of transcription factors and miRNAs, or by modifying the secondary 
structure of mRNAs.
RESULTS: In this paper we considered 22 human genetic diseases or traits, linked 
to 35 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in 27 different genes. We 
performed a local sequence context analysis in terms of the ribosomal pause 
propensity affected by synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that 
synonymous mutations related to the above mentioned mechanisms presented small 
pause propensity changes, whereas synonymous mutations that were not related to 
those mechanisms presented large pause propensity changes. On the other hand, we 
did not observe large variations in the codon usage of codons associated with 
these mutations. Furthermore, we showed that the changes in the pause propensity 
associated with benign sSNPs are significantly lower than the pause propensity 
changes related to sSNPs associated to diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the genetic diseases or traits related 
to synonymous mutations with large pause propensity changes, could be the 
consequence of another mechanism underlying non-silent synonymous mutations. 
Namely, alternative protein configuration related, in turn, to alterations in 
the ribosome-mediated translational attenuation program encoded by pairs of 
consecutive codons, not codons. These findings shed light on the latter 
mechanism based on the perturbation of the co-translational folding process.

Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) proteins are evolutionary 
conserved RNA-binding proteins that control mRNA polyadenylation and 
translation. Orthologs in humans and other vertebrates are mainly involved in 
oogenesis. This is also the case for the C. elegans CPEB family member CPB-3, 
whereas two further CPEB proteins (CPB-1 and FOG-1) are involved in 
spermatogenesis. Here we describe the characterisation of a new missense allele 
of cpb-3 and show that loss of cpb-3 function leads to an increase in 
physiological germ cell death. To better understand the interaction and effect 
of C. elegans CPEB proteins on processes such as physiological apoptosis, germ 
cell differentiation, and regulation of gene expression, we characterised 
changes in the transcriptome and proteome of C. elegans CPEB mutants. Our 
results show that, despite their sequence similarities CPEB family members tend 
to have distinct overall effects on gene expression (both at the transcript and 
protein levels). This observation is consistent with the distinct phenotypes 
observed in the various CPEB family mutants.

The network of molecular chaperones mediates the folding and translocation of 
the many proteins encoded in the genome of eukaryotic organisms, as well as a 
response to stress. It has been particularly well characterised in the budding 
yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where 63 known chaperones have been annotated 
and recent affinity purification and MS/MS experiments have helped characterise 
the attendant network of chaperone targets to a high degree. In this study, we 
apply our QconCAT methodology to directly quantify the set of yeast chaperones 
in absolute terms (copies per cell) via SRM MS. Firstly, we compare these to 
existing quantitative estimates of these yeast proteins, highlighting 
differences between approaches. Secondly, we cast the results into the context 
of the chaperone target network and show a distinct relationship between 
abundance of individual chaperones and their targets. This allows us to 
characterise the 'throughput' of protein molecules passing through individual 
chaperones and their groups on a proteome-wide scale in an unstressed model 
eukaryote for the first time. The results demonstrate specialisations of the 
chaperone classes, which display different overall workloads, efficiencies and 
preference for the sub-cellular localisation of their targets. The novel 
integration of the interactome data with quantification supports re-estimates of 
the level of protein throughout going through molecular chaperones. 
Additionally, although chaperones target fewer than 40% of annotated proteins we 
show that they mediate the folding of the majority of protein molecules (∼62% of 
the total protein flux in the cell), highlighting their importance.

The coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) controls viral genome packaging and 
contains numerous phosphorylation sites located within unstructured regions. 
Binding of phosphorylated SARS-CoV N to the host 14-3-3 protein in the cytoplasm 
was reported to regulate nucleocytoplasmic N shuttling. All seven isoforms of 
the human 14-3-3 are abundantly present in tissues vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, 
where N can constitute up to ~1% of expressed proteins during infection. 
Although the association between 14-3-3 and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins can represent 
one of the key host-pathogen interactions, its molecular mechanism and the 
specific critical phosphosites are unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylated 
SARS-CoV-2 N protein (pN) dimers, reconstituted via bacterial co-expression with 
protein kinase A, directly associate, in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, 
with the dimeric 14-3-3 protein, but not with its monomeric mutant. We 
demonstrate that pN is recognized by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms with 
various efficiencies and deduce the apparent KD to selected isoforms, showing 
that these are in a low micromolar range. Serial truncations pinpointed a 
critical phosphorylation site to Ser197, which is conserved among related 
zoonotic coronaviruses and located within the functionally important, SR-rich 
region of N. The relatively tight 14-3-3/pN association could regulate 
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and other functions of N via occlusion of the 
SR-rich region, and could also hijack cellular pathways by 14-3-3 sequestration. 
As such, the assembly may represent a valuable target for therapeutic 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: By 2016, signs of emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to 
artemisinin and partner drugs were detected in the Greater Mekong Subregion. 
Recently, the independent evolution of artemisinin resistance has also been 
reported in Africa and South America. This alarming scenario calls for the 
urgent development of new antimalarials with novel modes of action. We 
investigated the interference with protein aggregation, which is potentially 
toxic for the cell and occurs abundantly in all Plasmodium stages, as a hitherto 
unexplored drug target in the pathogen.
RESULTS: Attempts to exacerbate the P. falciparum proteome's propensity to 
aggregation by delivering endogenous aggregative peptides to in vitro cultures 
of this parasite did not significantly affect their growth. In contrast, protein 
aggregation inhibitors clearly reduced the pathogen's viability. One such 
compound, the bis(styrylpyridinium) salt YAT2150, exhibited potent 
antiplasmodial activity with an in vitro IC50 of 90 nM for chloroquine- and 
artemisinin-resistant lines, arresting asexual blood parasites at the 
trophozoite stage, as well as interfering with the development of both sexual 
and hepatic forms of Plasmodium. At its IC50, this compound is a powerful 
inhibitor of the aggregation of the model amyloid β peptide fragment 1-40, and 
it reduces the amount of aggregated proteins in P. falciparum cultures, 
suggesting that the underlying antimalarial mechanism consists in a generalized 
impairment of proteostasis in the pathogen. YAT2150 has an easy, rapid, and 
inexpensive synthesis, and because it fluoresces when it accumulates in its main 
localization in the Plasmodium cytosol, it is a theranostic agent.
CONCLUSIONS: Inhibiting protein aggregation in Plasmodium significantly reduces 
the parasite's viability in vitro. Since YAT2150 belongs to a novel structural 
class of antiplasmodials with a mode of action that potentially targets multiple 
gene products, rapid evolution of resistance to this drug is unlikely to occur, 
making it a promising compound for the post-artemisinin era.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) regulates metabolic physiology. However, nearly all 
mechanistic studies of BAT protein function occur in a single inbred mouse 
strain, which has limited the understanding of generalizable mechanisms of BAT 
regulation over physiology. Here, we perform deep quantitative proteomics of BAT 
across a cohort of 163 genetically defined diversity outbred mice, a model that 
parallels the genetic and phenotypic variation found in humans. We leverage this 
diversity to define the functional architecture of the outbred BAT proteome, 
comprising 10,479 proteins. We assign co-operative functions to 2,578 proteins, 
enabling systematic discovery of regulators of BAT. We also identify 638 
proteins that correlate with protection from, or sensitivity to, at least one 
parameter of metabolic disease. We use these findings to uncover SFXN5, LETMD1, 
and ATP1A2 as modulators of BAT thermogenesis or adiposity, and provide OPABAT 
as a resource for understanding the conserved mechanisms of BAT regulation over 
metabolic physiology.

Three stop codons in bacteria represent different translation termination 
signals, and their usage is expected to depend on their differences in 
translation termination efficiency, mutation bias, and relative abundance of 
release factors (RF1 decoding UAA and UAG, and RF2 decoding UAA and UGA). In 14 
bacterial species (covering Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, 
Actinobacteria and Spirochetes) with cellular RF1 and RF2 quantified, UAA is 
consistently over-represented in highly expressed genes (HEGs) relative to lowly 
expressed genes (LEGs), whereas UGA usage is the opposite even in species where 
RF2 is far more abundant than RF1. UGA usage relative to UAG increases 
significantly with PRF2 [=RF2/(RF1 + RF2)] as expected from adaptation between 
stop codons and their decoders. PRF2 is > 0.5 over a wide range of AT content 
(measured by PAT3 as the proportion of AT at third codon sites), but decreases 
rapidly toward zero at the high range of PAT3 This explains why bacterial 
lineages with high PAT3 often have UGA reassigned because of low RF2. There is 
no indication that UAG is a minor stop codon in bacteria as claimed in a recent 
publication. The claim is invalid because of the failure to apply the two key 
criteria in identifying a minor codon: (1) it is least preferred by HEGs (or 
most preferred by LEGs) and (2) it corresponds to the least abundant decoder. 
Our results suggest a more plausible explanation for why UAA usage increases, 
and UGA usage decreases, with PAT3, but UAG usage remains low over the entire 
PAT3 range.

BACKGROUND: Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) allow predicting metabolic 
phenotypes from limited data on uptake and secretion fluxes by defining the 
space of all the feasible solutions and excluding physio-chemically and 
biologically unfeasible behaviors. The integration of additional biological 
information in genome-scale models, e.g., transcriptomic or proteomic profiles, 
has the potential to improve phenotype prediction accuracy. This is particularly 
important for metabolic engineering applications where more accurate model 
predictions can translate to more reliable model-based strain design.
RESULTS: Here we present a GEM with Enzymatic Constraints using Kinetic and 
Omics data (GECKO) model of Bacillus subtilis, which uses publicly available 
proteomic data and enzyme kinetic parameters for central carbon (CC) metabolic 
reactions to constrain the flux solution space. This model allows more accurate 
prediction of the flux distribution and growth rate of wild-type and 
single-gene/operon deletion strains compared to a standard genome-scale 
metabolic model. The flux prediction error decreased by 43% and 36% for 
wild-type and mutants respectively. The model additionally increased the number 
of correctly predicted essential genes in CC pathways by 2.5-fold and 
significantly decreased flux variability in more than 80% of the reactions with 
variable flux. Finally, the model was used to find new gene deletion targets to 
optimize the flux toward the biosynthesis of poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) 
polymer in engineered B. subtilis. We implemented the single-reaction deletion 
targets identified by the model experimentally and showed that the new strains 
have a twofold higher γ-PGA concentration and production rate compared to the 
ancestral strain.
CONCLUSIONS: This work confirms that integration of enzyme constraints is a 
powerful tool to improve existing genome-scale models, and demonstrates the 
successful use of enzyme-constrained models in B. subtilis metabolic 
engineering. We expect that the new model can be used to guide future metabolic 
engineering efforts in the important industrial production host B. subtilis.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) secondary structure decreases the elongation rate, as 
ribosomes must unwind every structure they encounter during translation. 
Therefore, the strength of mRNA secondary structure is assumed to be reduced in 
highly translated mRNAs. However, previous studies in vitro reported a positive 
correlation between mRNA folding strength and protein abundance. The 
counterintuitive finding suggests that mRNA secondary structure affects 
translation efficiency in an undetermined manner. Here, we analyzed the folding 
behavior of mRNA during translation and its effect on translation efficiency. We 
simulated translation process based on a novel computational model, taking into 
account the interactions among ribosomes, codon usage and mRNA secondary 
structures. We showed that mRNA secondary structure shortens ribosomal distance 
through the dynamics of folding strength. Notably, when adjacent ribosomes are 
close, mRNA secondary structures between them disappear, and codon usage 
determines the elongation rate. More importantly, our results showed that the 
combined effect of mRNA secondary structure and codon usage in highly translated 
mRNAs causes a short ribosomal distance in structural regions, which in turn 
eliminates the structures during translation, leading to a high elongation rate. 
Together, these findings reveal how the dynamics of mRNA secondary structure 
coupling with codon usage affect translation efficiency.

The general transcription factor IID (TFIID) is the first component of the 
preinitiation complex (PIC) to bind the core promoter of RNA polymerase II 
transcribed genes. Despite its critical role in protein-encoded gene expression, 
how TFIID engages promoter DNA remains elusive. We have previously revealed a 
winged-helix DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal region of the largest TFIID 
subunit, TAF1. Here, we report the identification of a second DNA-binding module 
in the C-terminal half of human TAF1, which is encoded by a previously 
uncharacterized conserved zinc knuckle domain. We show that the TAF1 zinc 
knuckle aids in the recruit of TFIID to endogenous promoters vital for cellular 
proliferation. Mutation of the TAF1 zinc knuckle with defects in DNA binding 
compromises promoter occupancy of TFIID, which leads to a decrease in 
transcription and cell viability. Together, our studies provide a foundation to 
understand how TAF1 plays a central role in TFIID promoter binding and 
regulation of transcription initiation.

How cancer cells globally struggle with a chemotherapeutic insult before 
succumbing to apoptosis is largely unknown. Here we use an integrated 
systems-level examination of transcription, translation, and proteolysis to 
understand these events central to cancer treatment. As a model we study myeloma 
cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, a first-line therapy. 
Despite robust transcriptional changes, unbiased quantitative proteomics detects 
production of only a few critical anti-apoptotic proteins against a background 
of general translation inhibition. Simultaneous ribosome profiling further 
reveals potential translational regulation of stress response genes. Once the 
apoptotic machinery is engaged, degradation by caspases is largely independent 
of upstream bortezomib effects. Moreover, previously uncharacterized non-caspase 
proteolytic events also participate in cellular deconstruction. Our 
systems-level data also support co-targeting the anti-apoptotic regulator HSF1 
to promote cell death by bortezomib. This integrated approach offers unique, 
in-depth insight into apoptotic dynamics that may prove important to preclinical 
evaluation of any anti-cancer compound.

Detecting relative rather than absolute changes in extracellular signals enables 
cells to make decisions in constantly fluctuating environments. It is currently 
not well understood how mammalian signaling networks store the memories of past 
stimuli and subsequently use them to compute relative signals, that is perform 
fold change detection. Using the growth factor-activated PI3K-Akt signaling 
pathway, we develop here computational and analytical models, and experimentally 
validate a novel non-transcriptional mechanism of relative sensing in mammalian 
cells. This mechanism relies on a new form of cellular memory, where cells 
effectively encode past stimulation levels in the abundance of cognate receptors 
on the cell surface. The surface receptor abundance is regulated by background 
signal-dependent receptor endocytosis and down-regulation. We show the 
robustness and specificity of relative sensing for two physiologically important 
ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and 
across wide ranges of background stimuli. Our results suggest that similar 
mechanisms of cell memory and fold change detection may be important in diverse 
signaling cascades and multiple biological contexts.

Models of mRNA translation usually presume that transcripts are linear; upon 
reaching the end of a transcript each terminating ribosome returns to the 
cytoplasmic pool before initiating anew on a different transcript. A consequence 
of linear models is that faster translation of a given mRNA is unlikely to 
generate more of the encoded protein, particularly at low ribosome availability. 
Recent evidence indicates that eukaryotic mRNAs are circularized, potentially 
allowing terminating ribosomes to preferentially reinitiate on the same 
transcript. Here we model the effect of ribosome reinitiation on translation and 
show that, at high levels of reinitiation, protein synthesis rates are dominated 
by the time required to translate a given transcript. Our model provides a 
simple mechanistic explanation for many previously enigmatic features of 
eukaryotic translation, including the negative correlation of both ribosome 
densities and protein abundance on transcript length, the importance of codon 
usage in determining protein synthesis rates, and the negative correlation 
between transcript length and both codon adaptation and 5' mRNA folding 
energies. In contrast to linear models where translation is largely limited by 
initiation rates, our model reveals that all three stages of 
translation-initiation, elongation, and termination/reinitiation-determine 
protein synthesis rates even at low ribosome availability.

Position Matters: Network Centrality Considerably Impacts Rates of Protein 
Evolution in the Human Protein-Protein Interaction Network.

The proteins of any organism evolve at disparate rates. A long list of factors 
affecting rates of protein evolution have been identified. However, the relative 
importance of each factor in determining rates of protein evolution remains 
unresolved. The prevailing view is that evolutionary rates are dominantly 
determined by gene expression, and that other factors such as network centrality 
have only a marginal effect, if any. However, this view is largely based on 
analyses in yeasts, and accurately measuring the importance of the determinants 
of rates of protein evolution is complicated by the fact that the different 
factors are often correlated with each other, and by the relatively poor quality 
of available functional genomics data sets. Here, we use correlation, partial 
correlation and principal component regression analyses to measure the 
contributions of several factors to the variability of the rates of evolution of 
human proteins. For this purpose, we analyzed the entire human protein-protein 
interaction data set and the human signal transduction network-a network data 
set of exceptionally high quality, obtained by manual curation, which is 
expected to be virtually free from false positives. In contrast with the 
prevailing view, we observe that network centrality (measured as the number of 
physical and nonphysical interactions, betweenness, and closeness) has a 
considerable impact on rates of protein evolution. Surprisingly, the impact of 
centrality on rates of protein evolution seems to be comparable, or even 
superior according to some analyses, to that of gene expression. Our 
observations seem to be independent of potentially confounding factors and from 
the limitations (biases and errors) of interactomic data sets.

Translation initiation in prokaryotes is affected by the mRNA folding and 
interaction of the ribosome binding site with the ribosomal RNA. The elongation 
rate is affected, among other factors, by the local biophysical properties of 
the coding regions, the decoding rates of different codons, and the interactions 
among ribosomes. Currently, there is no comprehensive biophysical model of 
translation that enables the prediction of mRNA translation dynamics based only 
on the transcript sequence and while considering all of these fundamental 
aspects of translation. In this study, we provide, for the first time, a 
computational simulative biophysical model of both translation initiation and 
elongation with all aspects mentioned above. We demonstrate our model 
performance and advantages focusing on Escherichia coli genes. We further show 
that the model enables prediction of translation rate, protein levels, and 
ribosome densities. In addition, our model enables quantifying the effect of 
silent mutations on translation rate in different parts of the transcript, the 
relative effect of mutations on translation initiation and elongation, and the 
effect of mutations on ribosome traffic jams. Thus, unlike previous models, the 
proposed one provides comprehensive information, facilitating future research in 
disciplines such as molecular evolution, synthetic biology, and functional 
genomics. A toolkit to estimate translation dynamics of transcripts is available 
at: https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/∼tamirtul/transim.

Protein turnover maintains the recycling needs of the proteome, and its 
malfunction has been linked to aging and age-related diseases. However, not 
all proteins turnover equally, and the factors that contribute to accelerate or 
slow down turnover are mostly unknown. We measured turnover rates for 3,160 
proteins in exponentially growing yeast and analyzed their dependence on 
physical, functional, and genetic properties. We found that functional 
characteristics, including protein localization, complex membership, and 
connectivity, have greater effect on turnover than sequence elements. We also 
found that protein turnover and mRNA turnover are correlated. Analysis under 
nutrient perturbation and osmotic stress revealed that protein turnover highly 
depends on cellular state and is faster when proteins are being actively used. 
Finally, stress-induced changes in protein and transcript abundance correlated 
with changes in protein turnover. This study provides a resource of protein 
turnover rates and principles to understand the recycling needs of the proteome 
under basal conditions and perturbation.

Systematic assessment of tyrosine kinase-substrate relationships is fundamental 
to a better understanding of cellular signaling and its profound alterations in 
human diseases such as cancer. In human cells, such assessments are confounded 
by complex signaling networks, feedback loops, conditional activity, and 
intra-kinase redundancy. Here we address this challenge by exploiting the yeast 
proteome as an in vivo model substrate. We individually expressed 16 human 
non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified 
3,279 kinase-substrate relationships involving 1,351 yeast phosphotyrosine (pY) 
sites. Based on the yeast data without prior information, we generated a set of 
linear kinase motifs and assigned ∼1,300 known human pY sites to specific NRTKs. 
Furthermore, experimentally defined pY sites for each individual kinase were 
shown to cluster within the yeast interactome network irrespective of linear 
motif information. We therefore applied a network inference approach to predict 
kinase-substrate relationships for more than 3,500 human proteins, providing a 
resource to advance our understanding of kinase biology.

Sirtuin 7 plays a role in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis.

It has been shown that SIRT7 regulates rDNA transcription and that reduced SIRT7 
levels inhibit tumor growth. This anti-tumor effect could be due to reduced Pol 
I activity and perturbed ribosome biogenesis. In this study, using pulse 
labeling with RNA and amino acid analogs, we found that SIRT7 knockdown 
efficiently suppressed both RNA and protein synthesis. Surprisingly, SIRT7 
knockdown preferentially inhibited protein synthesis over rDNA transcription, 
whereas the levels of both were reduced to similar extents following Pol I 
knockdown. Using an affinity purification mass spectrometry approach and 
functional analyses of the resulting SIRT7 interactome, we identified and 
validated SIRT7 interactions with proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis. 
Indeed, SIRT7 co-fractionated with monoribosomes within a sucrose gradient. 
Using reciprocal isolations, we determined that SIRT7 interacts specifically 
with mTOR and GTF3C1, a component of the Pol III transcription factor TFIIIC2 
complex. Further studies found that SIRT7 knockdown triggered an increase in the 
levels of LC3B-II, an autophagosome marker, suggesting a link between SIRT7 and 
the mTOR pathway. Additionally, we provide several lines of evidence that SIRT7 
plays a role in modulating Pol III function. Immunoaffinity purification of 
SIRT7-GFP from a nuclear fraction demonstrated specific SIRT7 interaction with 
five out of six components of the TFIIIC2 complex, but not with the TFIIIA or 
TFIIIB complex, the former of which is required for Pol III-dependent 
transcription of tRNA genes. ChIP assays showed SIRT7 localization to the Pol 
III targeting genes, and SIRT7 knockdown triggered a reduction in tRNA levels. 
Taken together, these data suggest that SIRT7 may regulate Pol III transcription 
through mTOR and the TFIIIC2 complex. We propose that SIRT7 is involved in 
multiple pathways involved in ribosome biogenesis, and we hypothesize that its 
down-regulation may contribute to an antitumor effect, partly through the 
inhibition of protein synthesis.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) E1 helicase promotes viral DNA replication 
through its DNA unwinding activity and association with host factors. The E1 
proteins from anogenital HPV types interact with the cellular WD 
repeat-containing factor UAF1 (formerly known as p80). Specific amino acid 
substitutions in E1 that impair this interaction inhibit maintenance of the 
viral episome in immortalized keratinocytes and reduce viral DNA replication by 
up to 70% in transient assays. In this study, we determined by affinity 
purification of UAF1 that it interacts with three deubiquitinating enzymes in 
C33A cervical carcinoma cells: USP1, a nuclear protein, and the two cytoplasmic 
enzymes USP12 and USP46. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that E1 
assembles into a ternary complex with UAF1 and any one of these three USPs. 
Moreover, expression of E1 leads to a redistribution of USP12 and USP46 from the 
cytoplasm to the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies further revealed 
that E1 recruits these threes USPs to the viral origin in association with UAF1. 
The function of USP1, USP12, and USP46 in viral DNA replication was investigated 
by overproduction of catalytically inactive versions of these enzymes in 
transient assays. All three dominant negative USPs reduced HPV31 DNA replication 
by up to 60%, an effect that was specific, as it was not observed in assays 
performed with a truncated E1 lacking the UAF1-binding domain or with bovine 
papillomavirus 1 E1, which does not bind UAF1. These results highlight the 
importance of the USP1, USP12, and USP46 deubiquitinating enzymes in anogenital 
HPV DNA replication.
IMPORTANCE: Human papillomaviruses are small DNA tumor viruses that induce 
benign and malignant lesions of the skin and mucosa. HPV types that infect the 
anogenital tract are the etiological agents of cervical cancer, the majority of 
anal cancers, and a growing proportion of head-and-neck cancers. Replication of 
the HPV genome requires the viral protein E1, a DNA helicase that also interacts 
with host factors to promote viral DNA synthesis. We previously reported that 
the E1 helicase from anogenital HPV types associates with the WD40 
repeat-containing protein UAF1. Here, we show that UAF1 bridges the interaction 
of E1 with three deubiquitinating enzymes, USP1, USP12, and USP46. We further 
show that these deubiquitinases are recruited by E1/UAF1 to the viral origin of 
DNA replication and that overexpression of catalytically inactive versions of 
these enzymes reduces viral DNA replication. These results highlight the need 
for an E1-associated deubiquitinase activity in anogenital HPV genome 
replication.

High-throughput studies have been widely used to identify protein-protein 
interactions; however, few of these candidate interactions have been confirmed 
in vitro. We have used a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry and 
fluorescence anisotropy to screen candidate interactions within the pantothenate 
biosynthetic pathway. In particular, we observed no interaction between the next 
enzyme in the pathway, pantothenate synthetase (PS), and aspartate 
decarboxylase, but did observe an interaction between PS and the putative Nudix 
hydrolase, YfcD. Confirmation of the interaction by fluorescence anisotropy was 
dependent upon labelling an adventitiously formed glycine on the protein 
N-terminal affinity purification tag by using Sortase. Subsequent formation of 
the protein-protein complex led to apparent restriction of the dynamics of this 
tag, thus suggesting that this approach could be generally applied to a subset 
of other protein-protein interaction complexes.

Antibody-based research applications are critical for biological discovery. Yet 
there are no industry standards for comparing the performance of antibodies in 
various applications. We describe a knockout cell line-based antibody 
characterization platform, developed and approved jointly by industry and 
academic researchers, that enables the systematic comparison of antibody 
performance in western blot, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. The 
scalable protocols, which require minimal technological resources, consist of 
(1) the identification of appropriate cell lines for antibody characterization 
studies, (2) development/contribution of isogenic knockout controls, and (3) a 
series of antibody characterization procedures focused on the most common 
applications of antibodies in research. We provide examples of expected outcomes 
to guide antibody users in evaluating antibody performance. Central to our 
approach is advocating for transparent and open data sharing, enabling a 
community effort to identify specific antibodies for all human proteins. 
Mid-level graduate students with training in biochemistry and prior experience 
in cell culture and microscopy can complete the protocols for a specific protein 
within 1 month while working part-time on this effort. Antibody characterization 
is needed to meet standards for resource validation and data reproducibility, 
which are increasingly required by journals and funding agencies.

Protein phosphorylation is a key mechanism to regulate protein functions. 
However, the contribution of this protein modification to species divergence is 
still largely unknown. Here, we studied the evolution of mammalian 
phosphoregulation by comparing the human and mouse phosphoproteomes. We found 
that 84% of the positions that are phosphorylated in one species or the other 
are conserved at the residue level. Twenty percent of these conserved sites are 
phosphorylated in both species. This proportion is 2.5 times more than expected 
by chance alone, suggesting that purifying selection is preserving 
phosphoregulation. However, we show that the majority of the sites that are 
conserved at the residue level are differentially phosphorylated between 
species. These sites likely result from false-negative identifications due to 
incomplete experimental coverage, false-positive identifications and 
non-functional sites. In addition, our results suggest that at least 5% of them 
are likely to be true differentially phosphorylated sites and may thus 
contribute to the divergence in phosphorylation networks between mouse and 
humans and this, despite residue conservation between orthologous proteins. We 
also showed that evolutionary turnover of phosphosites at adjacent positions (in 
a distance range of up to 40 amino acids) in human or mouse leads to an over 
estimation of the divergence in phosphoregulation between these two species. 
These sites tend to be phosphorylated by the same kinases, supporting the 
hypothesis that they are functionally redundant. Our results support the 
hypothesis that the evolutionary turnover of phosphorylation sites contributes 
to the divergence in phosphorylation profiles while preserving 
phosphoregulation. Overall, our study provides advanced analyses of mammalian 
phosphoproteomes and a framework for the study of their contribution to 
phenotypic evolution.

MOTIVATION: The recent shift towards high-throughput screening is posing new 
challenges for the interpretation of experimental results. Here we propose the 
cleverSuite approach for large-scale characterization of protein groups.
DESCRIPTION: The central part of the cleverSuite is the cleverMachine (CM), an 
algorithm that performs statistics on protein sequences by comparing their 
physico-chemical propensities. The second element is called cleverClassifier and 
builds on top of the models generated by the CM to allow classification of new 
datasets.
RESULTS: We applied the cleverSuite to predict secondary structure properties, 
solubility, chaperone requirements and RNA-binding abilities. Using 
cross-validation and independent datasets, the cleverSuite reproduces 
experimental findings with great accuracy and provides models that can be used

Assimilation and integration of "omics" technologies, including genomics, 
epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has readily altered the landscape of 
medical research in the last decade. The vast and complex nature of omics data 
can only be interpreted by linking molecular information at the organismic 
level, forming the foundation of systems biology. Research in pulmonary 
biology/medicine has necessitated integration of omics, network, systems and 
computational biology data to differentially diagnose, interpret, and 
prognosticate pulmonary diseases, facilitating improvement in therapy and 
treatment modalities. This review describes how to leverage this emerging 
technology in understanding pulmonary diseases at the systems level -called a 
"systomic" approach. Considering the operational wholeness of cellular and organ 
systems, diseased genome, proteome, and the metabolome needs to be 
conceptualized at the systems level to understand disease pathogenesis and 
progression. Currently available omics technology and resources require a 
certain degree of training and proficiency in addition to dedicated hardware and 
applications, making them relatively less user friendly for the pulmonary 
biologist and clinicians. Herein, we discuss the various strategies, 
computational tools and approaches required to study pulmonary diseases at the 
systems level for biomedical scientists and clinical researchers.

Roles of type 1A topoisomerases in genome maintenance in Escherichia coli.

In eukaryotes, type 1A topoisomerases (topos) act with RecQ-like helicases to 
maintain the stability of the genome. Despite having been the first type 1A 
enzymes to be discovered, much less is known about the involvement of the E. 
coli topo I (topA) and III (topB) enzymes in genome maintenance. These enzymes 
are thought to have distinct cellular functions: topo I regulates supercoiling 
and R-loop formation, and topo III is involved in chromosome segregation. To 
better characterize their roles in genome maintenance, we have used genetic 
approaches including suppressor screens, combined with microscopy for the 
examination of cell morphology and nucleoid shape. We show that topA mutants can 
suffer from growth-inhibitory and supercoiling-dependent chromosome segregation 
defects. These problems are corrected by deleting recA or recQ but not by 
deleting recJ or recO, indicating that the RecF pathway is not involved. Rather, 
our data suggest that RecQ acts with a type 1A topo on RecA-generated 
recombination intermediates because: 1-topo III overproduction corrects the 
defects and 2-recQ deletion and topo IIII overproduction are epistatic to recA 
deletion. The segregation defects are also linked to over-replication, as they 
are significantly alleviated by an oriC::aph suppressor mutation which is 
oriC-competent in topA null but not in isogenic topA+ cells. When both topo I 
and topo III are missing, excess supercoiling triggers growth inhibition that 
correlates with the formation of extremely long filaments fully packed with 
unsegregated and diffuse DNA. These phenotypes are likely related to replication 
from R-loops as they are corrected by overproducing RNase HI or by genetic 
suppressors of double topA rnhA mutants affecting constitutive stable DNA 
replication, dnaT::aph and rne::aph, which initiates from R-loops. Thus, 
bacterial type 1A topos maintain the stability of the genome (i) by preventing 
over-replication originating from oriC (topo I alone) and R-loops and (ii) by 
acting with RecQ.

The amyloid conformation is considered a fundamental state of proteins and the 
propensity to populate it a generic property of polypeptides. Multiple 
proteome-wide analyses addressed the presence of amyloidogenic regions in 
proteins, nurturing our understanding of their nature and biological 
implications. However, these analyses focused on highly aggregation-prone and 
hydrophobic stretches that are only marginally found in intrinsically disordered 
regions (IDRs). Here, we explore the prevalence of cryptic amyloidogenic regions 
(CARs) of polar nature in IDRs. CARs are widespread in IDRs and associated with 
IDPs function, with particular involvement in protein-protein interactions, but 
their presence is also connected to a risk of malfunction. By exploring this 
function/malfunction dichotomy, we speculate that ancestral CARs might have 
evolved into functional interacting regions playing a significant role in 
protein evolution at the origins of life.

It has been reported that genes up-regulated in cancer are often down-regulated 
in neurodegenerative disorders and vice versa. The fact that apparently 
unrelated diseases share functional pathways suggests a link between their 
etiopathogenesis and the properties of molecules involved. Are there specific 
features that explain the exclusive association of proteins with either cancer 
or neurodegeneration? We performed a large-scale analysis of physico-chemical 
properties to understand what characteristics differentiate classes of diseases. 
We found that structural disorder significantly distinguishes proteins 
up-regulated in neurodegenerative diseases from those linked to cancer. We also 
observed high correlation between structural disorder and age of onset in 
Frontotemporal Dementia, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, which strongly 
supports the role of protein unfolding in neurodegenerative processes.

Secreted Proteins Defy the Expression Level-Evolutionary Rate Anticorrelation.

The rates of evolution of the proteins of any organism vary across orders of 
magnitude. A primary factor influencing rates of protein evolution is 
expression. A strong negative correlation between expression levels and 
evolutionary rates (the so-called E-R anticorrelation) has been observed in 
virtually all studied organisms. This effect is currently attributed to the 
abundance-dependent fitness costs of misfolding and unspecific protein-protein 
interactions, among other factors. Secreted proteins are folded in the 
endoplasmic reticulum, a compartment where chaperones, folding catalysts, and 
stringent quality control mechanisms promote their correct folding and may 
reduce the fitness costs of misfolding. In addition, confinement of secreted 
proteins to the extracellular space may reduce misinteractions and their 
deleterious effects. We hypothesize that each of these factors (the secretory 
pathway quality control and extracellular location) may reduce the strength of 
the E-R anticorrelation. Indeed, here we show that among human proteins that are 
secreted to the extracellular space, rates of evolution do not correlate with 
protein abundances. This trend is robust to controlling for several potentially 
confounding factors and is also observed when analyzing protein abundance data 
for 6 human tissues. In addition, analysis of mRNA abundance data for 32 human 
tissues shows that the E-R correlation is always less negative, and sometimes 
nonsignificant, in secreted proteins. Similar observations were made in 
Caenorhabditis elegans and in Escherichia coli, and to a lesser extent in 
Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. Our 
observations contribute to understand the causes of the E-R anticorrelation.

The structure of the first protein-conducting channel was determined more than a 
decade ago. Today, we are still puzzled by the outstanding problem of protein 
translocation--the dynamic mechanism underlying the consignment of proteins 
across and into membranes. This review is an attempt to summarize and understand 
the energy transducing capabilities of protein-translocating machines, with 
emphasis on bacterial systems: how polypeptides make headway against the lipid 
bilayer and how the process is coupled to the free energy associated with ATP 
hydrolysis and the transmembrane protein motive force. In order to explore how 
cargo is driven across the membrane, the known structures of the 
protein-translocation machines are set out against the background of the 
historic literature, and in the light of experiments conducted in their wake. 
The paper will focus on the bacterial general secretory (Sec) pathway 
(SecY-complex), and its eukaryotic counterpart (Sec61-complex), which ferry 
proteins across the membrane in an unfolded state, as well as the unrelated Tat 
system that assembles bespoke channels for the export of folded proteins.

This release of the FunCoup database (http://funcoup.sbc.su.se) is the fourth 
generation of one of the most comprehensive databases for genome-wide functional 
association networks. These functional associations are inferred via integrating 
various data types using a naive Bayesian algorithm and orthology based 
information transfer across different species. This approach provides high 
coverage of the included genomes as well as high quality of inferred 
interactions. In this update of FunCoup we introduce four new eukaryotic 
species: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Bos taurus, Oryza 
sativa and open the database to the prokaryotic domain by including networks for 
Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The latter allows us to also introduce a 
new class of functional association between genes - co-occurrence in the same 
operon. We also supplemented the existing classes of functional association: 
metabolic, signaling, complex and physical protein interaction with up-to-date 
information. In this release we switched to InParanoid v8 as the source of 
orthology and base for calculation of phylogenetic profiles. While populating 
all other evidence types with new data we introduce a new evidence type based on 
quantitative mass spectrometry data. Finally, the new JavaScript based network 
viewer provides the user an intuitive and responsive platform to further 
evaluate the results.

Different genes and proteins evolve at very different rates. To identify the 
factors that explain these differences is an important aspect of research in 
molecular evolution. One such factor is the role a protein plays in a large 
molecular network. Here, we analyze the evolutionary rates of enzyme-coding 
genes in the genome-scale metabolic network of Escherichia coli to find the 
evolutionary constraints imposed by the structure and function of this complex 
metabolic system. Central and highly connected enzymes appear to evolve more 
slowly than less connected enzymes, but we find that they do so as a by-product 
of their high abundance, and not because of their position in the metabolic 
network. In contrast, enzymes catalyzing reactions with high metabolic flux-high 
substrate to product conversion rates-evolve slowly even after we account for 
their abundance. Moreover, enzymes catalyzing reactions that are difficult to 
by-pass through alternative pathways, such that they are essential in many 
different genetic backgrounds, also evolve more slowly. Our analyses show that 
an enzyme's role in the function of a metabolic network affects its evolution 
more than its place in the network's structure. They highlight the value of a 
system-level perspective for studies of molecular evolution.

Many antimicrobial and anti-tumour drugs elicit hormetic responses characterised 
by low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition. While this can have profound 
consequences for human health, with low drug concentrations actually stimulating 
pathogen or tumour growth, the mechanistic understanding behind such responses 
is still lacking. We propose a novel, simple but general mechanism that could 
give rise to hormesis in systems where an inhibitor acts on an enzyme. At its 
core is one of the basic building blocks in intracellular signalling, the dual 
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation motif, found in diverse regulatory processes 
including control of cell proliferation and programmed cell death. Our 
analytically-derived conditions for observing hormesis provide clues as to why 
this mechanism has not been previously identified. Current mathematical models 
regularly make simplifying assumptions that lack empirical support but 
inadvertently preclude the observation of hormesis. In addition, due to the 
inherent population heterogeneities, the presence of hormesis is likely to be 
masked in empirical population-level studies. Therefore, examining hormetic 
responses at single-cell level coupled with improved mathematical models could 
substantially enhance detection and mechanistic understanding of hormesis.

Cell-specific proteomics in multicellular systems and whole animals is a 
promising approach to understand the differentiated functions of cells and 
tissues. Here, we extend our stochastic orthogonal recoding of translation 
(SORT) approach for the co-translational tagging of proteomes with a 
cyclopropene-containing amino acid in response to diverse codons in genetically 
targeted cells, and create a tetrazine-biotin probe containing a cleavable 
linker that offers a way to enrich and identify tagged proteins. We demonstrate 
that SORT with enrichment, SORT-E, efficiently recovers and enriches SORT tagged 
proteins and enables specific identification of enriched proteins via mass 
spectrometry, including low-abundance proteins. We show that tagging at distinct 
codons enriches overlapping, but distinct sets of proteins, suggesting that 
tagging at more than one codon enhances proteome coverage. Using SORT-E, we 
accomplish cell-specific proteomics in the fly. These results suggest that 
SORT-E will enable the definition of cell-specific proteomes in animals during 
development, disease progression, and learning and memory.

It is generally assumed that tethering enhances rates of electron harvesting and 
delivery to active sites in multidomain enzymes by proximity and sampling 
mechanisms. Here, we explore this idea in a tethered 3-domain, trimeric 
copper-containing nitrite reductase. By reverse engineering, we find that 
tethering does not enhance the rate of electron delivery from its pendant 
cytochrome c to the catalytic copper-containing core. Using a linker that 
harbors a gatekeeper tyrosine in a nitrite access channel, the tethered haem 
domain enables catalysis by other mechanisms. Tethering communicates the redox 
state of the haem to the distant T2Cu center that helps initiate substrate 
binding for catalysis. It also tunes copper reduction potentials, suppresses 
reductive enzyme inactivation, enhances enzyme affinity for substrate, and 
promotes intercopper electron transfer. Tethering has multiple unanticipated 
beneficial roles, the combination of which fine-tunes function beyond simplistic 
mechanisms expected from proximity and restrictive sampling models.

Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases (PI5P4K), also known as type II PIPKs 
or PIPKIIs, convert the lipid second messenger PI5P to PI(4,5)P2. The PI5P4K 
family consists of three isozymes in mammals-PI5P4Kα, β, and γ-which notably 
utilize both GTP and ATP as phosphodonors. Unlike the other two isozymes, which 
can utilize both ATP and GTP, PI5P4Kβ exhibits a marked preference for GTP over 
ATP, acting as an intracellular GTP sensor that alters its kinase activity in 
response to physiological changes in GTP concentration. Knockout studies have 
demonstrated a critical role for PI5P4Kα and β in tumorigenesis, while PI5P4Kγ 
has been implicated in regulating immune and neural systems. Pharmacological 
targeting of PI5P4K holds promise for the development of new therapeutic 
approaches against cancer, immune dysfunction, and neurodegenerative diseases. 
Although several PI5P4K inhibitors have already been developed, challenges 
remain in PI5P4K inhibitor development, including a discrepancy between in vitro 
and cellular efficacy. This discrepancy is attributable to mainly three factors. 
(a) Most PI5P4K inhibitors were developed at low ATP levels, where these enzymes 
exhibit minimal activity. (b) Non-catalytic functions of PI5P4K require careful 
interpretation of PI5P4K depletion studies, as their scaffolding roles suppress 
class I PI3K signaling. (c) The lack of pharmacodynamic markers for in vivo 
assessment complicates efficacy assessment. To address these issues and promote 
the development of effective and targeted therapeutic strategies, this review 
provides an analytical overview of the distinct roles of individual isozymes and 
recent developments in PI5P4K inhibitors, emphasizing structural insights and 
the importance of pharmacodynamic marker identification.

The study of the 3D architecture of chromosomes has been advancing rapidly in 
recent years. While a number of methods for 3D reconstruction of genomic models 
based on Hi-C data were proposed, most of the analyses in the field have been 
performed on different 3D representation forms (such as graphs). Here, we 
reproduce most of the previous results on the 3D genomic organization of the 
eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae using analysis of 3D reconstructions. We show 
that many of these results can be reproduced in sparse reconstructions, 
generated from a small fraction of the experimental data (5% of the data), and 
study the properties of such models. Finally, we propose for the first time a 
novel approach for improving the accuracy of 3D reconstructions by introducing 
additional predicted physical interactions to the model, based on orthologous 
interactions in an evolutionary-related organism and based on predicted 
functional interactions between genes. We demonstrate that this approach indeed 
leads to the reconstruction of improved models.

Phosphorylation is the most widespread and well studied reversible 
posttranslational modification. Discovering tissue-specific preferences of 
phosphorylation sites is important as phosphorylation plays a role in regulating 
almost every cellular activity and disease state. Here we present a 
comprehensive analysis of global and tissue-specific sequence and structure 
properties of phosphorylation sites utilizing recent proteomics data. We 
identified tissue-specific motifs in both sequence and spatial environments of 
phosphorylation sites. Target site preferences of kinases across tissues 
indicate that, while many kinases mediate phosphorylation in all tissues, there 
are also kinases that exhibit more tissue-specific preferences which, notably, 
are not caused by tissue-specific kinase expression. We also demonstrate that 
many metabolic pathways are differentially regulated by phosphorylation in 
different tissues.

Large-scale protein-protein interaction data sets have been generated for 
several species including yeast and human and have enabled the identification, 
quantification, and prediction of cellular molecular networks. Affinity 
purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is the preeminent methodology for 
large-scale analysis of protein complexes, performed by immunopurifying a 
specific "bait" protein and its associated "prey" proteins. The analysis and 
interpretation of AP-MS data sets is, however, not straightforward. In addition, 
although yeast AP-MS data sets are relatively comprehensive, current human AP-MS 
data sets only sparsely cover the human interactome. Here we develop a framework 
for analysis of AP-MS data sets that addresses the issues of noise, missing 
data, and sparsity of coverage in the context of a current, real world human 
AP-MS data set. Our goal is to extend and increase the density of the known 
human interactome by integrating bait-prey and cocomplexed preys (prey-prey 
associations) into networks. Our framework incorporates a score for each 
identified protein, as well as elements of signal processing to improve the 
confidence of identified protein-protein interactions. We identify many protein 
networks enriched in known biological processes and functions. In addition, we 
show that integrated bait-prey and prey-prey interactions can be used to refine 
network topology and extend known protein networks.

Protein quantification at proteome-wide scale is an important aim, enabling 
insights into fundamental cellular biology and serving to constrain experiments 
and theoretical models. While proteome-wide quantification is not yet fully 
routine, many datasets approaching proteome-wide coverage are becoming available 
through biophysical and MS techniques. Data of this type can be accessed via a 
variety of sources, including publication supplements and online data 
repositories. However, access to the data is still fragmentary, and comparisons 
across experiments and organisms are not straightforward. Here, we describe 
recent updates to our database resource "PaxDb" (Protein Abundances Across 
Organisms). PaxDb focuses on protein abundance information at proteome-wide 
scope, irrespective of the underlying measurement technique. Quantification data 
is reprocessed, unified, and quality-scored, and then integrated to build a 
meta-resource. PaxDb also allows evolutionary comparisons through precomputed 
gene orthology relations. Recently, we have expanded the scope of the database 
to include cell-line samples, and more systematically scan the literature for 
suitable datasets. We report that a significant fraction of published 
experiments cannot readily be accessed and/or parsed for quantitative 
information, requiring additional steps and efforts. The current update brings 
PaxDb to 414 datasets in 53 organisms, with (semi-) quantitative abundance 
information covering more than 300,000 proteins.

UniProtKB amid the turmoil of plant proteomics research.

The UniProt KnowledgeBase (UniProtKB) provides a single, centralized, 
authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional information. The 
majority of its records is based on automatic translation of coding sequences 
(CDS) provided by submitters at the time of initial deposition to the nucleotide 
sequence databases (INSDC). This article will give a general overview of the 
current situation, with some specific illustrations extracted from our 
annotation of Arabidopsis and rice proteomes. More and more frequently, only the 
raw sequence of a complete genome is deposited to the nucleotide sequence 
databases and the gene model predictions and annotations are kept in separate, 
specialized model organism databases (MODs). In order to be able to provide the 
complete proteome of model organisms, UniProtKB had to implement pipelines for 
import of protein sequences from Ensembl and EnsemblGenomes. A single genome can 
be the target of several unrelated sequencing projects and the final assembly 
and gene model predictions may diverge quite significantly. In addition, several 
cultivars of the same species are often sequenced - 1001 Arabidopsis cultivars 
are currently under way - and the resulting proteomes are far from being 
identical. Therefore, one challenge for UniProtKB is to store and organize these 
data in a convenient way and to clearly defined reference proteomes that should 
be made available to users. Manual annotation is one of the landmarks of the 
Swiss-Prot section of UniProtKB. Besides adding functional annotation, curators 
are checking, and often correcting, gene model predictions. For plants, this 
task is limited to Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa subsp. japonica. 
Proteomics data providing experimental evidences confirming the existence of 
proteins or identifying sequence features such as post-translational 
modifications are also imported into UniProtKB records and the knowledgebase is 
cross-referenced to numerous proteomics resource.

Specific structures in mRNA modulate translation rate and thus can affect 
protein folding. Using the protein structures from two eukaryotes and three 
prokaryotes, we explore the connections between the protein compactness, 
inferred from solvent accessibility, and mRNA structure, inferred from mRNA 
folding energy (ΔG). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the ΔG value of the 
most stable 30 nucleotide segment of the mRNA (ΔGmin) strongly, positively 
correlates with protein solvent accessibility. Thus, mRNAs containing 
exceptionally stable secondary structure elements typically encode compact 
proteins. The correlations between ΔG and protein compactness are much more 
pronounced in predicted ordered parts of proteins compared to the predicted 
disordered parts, indicative of an important role of mRNA secondary structure 
elements in the control of protein folding. Additionally, ΔG correlates with the 
mRNA length and the evolutionary rate of synonymous positions. The correlations 
are partially independent and were used to construct multiple regression models 
which explain about half of the variance of protein solvent accessibility. These 
findings suggest a model in which the mRNA structure, particularly exceptionally 
stable RNA structural elements, act as gauges of protein co-translational 
folding by reducing ribosome speed when the nascent peptide needs time to form 
and optimize the core structure.

Intrinsically disordered protein regions are abundant in eukaryotic proteins and 
lack stable tertiary structures and enzymatic functions. Previous studies of 
disordered region evolution based on interspecific alignments have revealed an 
increased propensity for indels and rapid rates of amino acid substitution. How 
disordered regions are maintained at high abundance in the proteome and across 
taxa, despite apparently weak evolutionary constraints, remains unclear. Here, 
we use single nucleotide and indel polymorphism data in yeast and human 
populations to survey the population variation within disordered regions. First, 
we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms in disordered regions are under 
weaker negative selection compared with more structured protein regions and have 
a higher proportion of neutral non-synonymous sites. We also confirm previous 
findings that nonframeshifting indels are much more abundant in disordered 
regions relative to structured regions. We find that the rate of 
nonframeshifting indel polymorphism in intrinsically disordered regions 
resembles that of noncoding DNA and pseudogenes, and that large indels segregate 
in disordered regions in the human population. Our survey of polymorphism 
confirms patterns of evolution in disordered regions inferred based on longer 
evolutionary comparisons.

Protein translation is a central step in gene expression and affected by many 
factors such as codon usage bias, mRNA folding energy and tRNA abundance. 
Despite intensive previous studies, how metabolic amino acid supply correlates 
with protein translation efficiency remains unknown. In this work, we estimated 
the amino acid flux from metabolic network for each protein in Escherichia coli 
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using Flux Balance Analysis. Integrated with the 
mRNA expression level, protein abundance and ribosome profiling data, we 
provided a detailed description of the role of amino acid supply in protein 
translation. Our results showed that amino acid supply positively correlates 
with translation efficiency and ribosome density. Moreover, with the rank-based 
regression model, we found that metabolic amino acid supply facilitates ribosome 
utilization. Based on the fact that the ribosome density change of 
well-amino-acid-supplied genes is smaller than poorly-amino-acid-supply genes 
under amino acid starvation, we reached the conclusion that amino acid supply 
may buffer ribosome density change against amino acid starvation and benefit 
maintaining a relatively stable translation environment. Our work provided new 
insights into the connection between metabolic amino acid supply and protein 
translation process by revealing a new regulation strategy that is dependent on 
resource availability.

The aggregation of proteins compromises cell fitness, either because it titrates 
functional proteins into non-productive inclusions or because it results in the 
formation of toxic assemblies. Accordingly, computational proteome-wide analyses 
suggest that prevention of aggregation upon misfolding plays a key role in 
sequence evolution. Most proteins spend their lifetimes in a folded state; 
therefore, it is conceivable that, in addition to sequences, protein structures 
would have also evolved to minimize the risk of aggregation in their natural 
environments. By exploiting the AGGRESCAN3D structure-based approach to predict 
the aggregation propensity of >600 Escherichia coli proteins, we show that the 
structural aggregation propensity of globular proteins is connected with their 
abundance, length, essentiality, subcellular location and quaternary structure. 
These data suggest that the avoidance of protein aggregation has contributed to 
shape the structural properties of proteins in bacterial cells.

Gene duplication is a driver of the evolution of new functions. The duplication 
of genes encoding homomeric proteins leads to the formation of homomers and 
heteromers of paralogs, creating new complexes after a single duplication event. 
The loss of these heteromers may be required for the two paralogs to evolve 
independent functions. Using yeast as a model, we find that heteromerization is 
frequent among duplicated homomers and correlates with functional similarity 
between paralogs. Using in silico evolution, we show that for homomers and 
heteromers sharing binding interfaces, mutations in one paralog can have 
structural pleiotropic effects on both interactions, resulting in highly 
correlated responses of the complexes to selection. Therefore, heteromerization 
could be preserved indirectly due to selection for the maintenance of homomers, 
thus slowing down functional divergence between paralogs. We suggest that 
paralogs can overcome the obstacle of structural pleiotropy by regulatory 
evolution at the transcriptional and post-translational levels.

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) have been widely used for the phenotypic 
prediction of microorganisms. However, the lack of other constraints in the 
stoichiometric model often leads to a large metabolic solution space being 
inaccessible. Inspired by previous studies that take an allocation of 
macromolecule resources into account, we developed a simplified Python-based 
workflow for constructing enzymatic constrained metabolic network model (ECMpy) 
and constructed an enzyme-constrained model for Escherichia coli (eciML1515) by 
directly adding a total enzyme amount constraint in the latest version of GEM 
for E. coli (iML1515), considering the protein subunit composition in the 
reaction, and automated calibration of enzyme kinetic parameters. Using 
eciML1515, we predicted the overflow metabolism of E. coli and revealed that 
redox balance was the key reason for the difference between E. coli and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae in overflow metabolism. The growth rate predictions on 
24 single-carbon sources were improved significantly when compared with other 
enzyme-constrained models of E. coli. Finally, we revealed the tradeoff between 
enzyme usage efficiency and biomass yield by exploring the metabolic behaviours 
under different substrate consumption rates. Enzyme-constrained models can 
improve simulation accuracy and thus can predict cellular phenotypes under 
various genetic perturbations more precisely, providing reliable guidance for 
metabolic engineering.

Protein aggregation into intracellular inclusions is a key feature of many 
neurodegenerative disorders. A common theme has emerged that inappropriate 
self-aggregation of misfolded or mutant polypeptide sequences is detrimental to 
cell health. Yet protein quality control mechanisms may also deliberately 
cluster them together into distinct inclusion subtypes, including the insoluble 
protein deposit (IPOD) and the juxtanuclear quality control (JUNQ). Here we 
investigated how the intrinsic oligomeric state of three model systems of 
disease-relevant mutant protein and peptide sequences relates to the IPOD and 
JUNQ patterns of aggregation using sedimentation velocity analysis. Two of the 
models (polyalanine (37A) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutants A4V and 
G85R) accumulated into the same JUNQ-like inclusion whereas the other, 
polyglutamine (72Q), formed spatially distinct IPOD-like inclusions. Using flow 
cytometry pulse shape analysis (PulSA) to separate cells with inclusions from 
those without revealed the SOD1 mutants and 37A to have abruptly altered 
oligomeric states with respect to the nonaggregating forms, regardless of 
whether cells had inclusions or not, whereas 72Q was almost exclusively 
monomeric until inclusions formed. We propose that mutations leading to JUNQ 
inclusions induce a constitutively "misfolded" state exposing hydrophobic side 
chains that attract and ultimately overextend protein quality capacity, which 
leads to aggregation into JUNQ inclusions. Poly(Q) is not misfolded in this same 
sense due to universal polar side chains, but is highly prone to forming amyloid 
fibrils that we propose invoke a different engagement mechanism with quality 
control.

A computational model of liver iron metabolism.

Iron is essential for all known life due to its redox properties; however, these 
same properties can also lead to its toxicity in overload through the production 
of reactive oxygen species. Robust systemic and cellular control are required to 
maintain safe levels of iron, and the liver seems to be where this regulation is 
mainly located. Iron misregulation is implicated in many diseases, and as our 
understanding of iron metabolism improves, the list of iron-related disorders 
grows. Recent developments have resulted in greater knowledge of the fate of 
iron in the body and have led to a detailed map of its metabolism; however, a 
quantitative understanding at the systems level of how its components interact 
to produce tight regulation remains elusive. A mechanistic computational model 
of human liver iron metabolism, which includes the core regulatory components, 
is presented here. It was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation 
and on their kinetic properties, obtained from several publications. The model 
was then quantitatively validated by comparing its results with previously 
published physiological data, and it is able to reproduce multiple experimental 
findings. A time course simulation following an oral dose of iron was compared 
to a clinical time course study and the simulation was found to recreate the 
dynamics and time scale of the systems response to iron challenge. A disease 
state simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a single reaction 
parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation. The 
simulation provides a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that 
arises in this disease. This model supports and supplements understanding of the 
role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further 
modelling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of 
experiments to improve further our knowledge of this system.

The biological significance of the DHTKD1-encoded 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase 
(OADH) remains obscure due to its catalytic redundancy with the ubiquitous 
OGDH-encoded 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH). In this work, metabolic 
contributions of OADH and OGDH are discriminated by exposure of cells/tissues 
with different DHTKD1 expression to the synthesized phosphonate analogues of 
homologous 2-oxodicarboxylates. The saccharopine pathway intermediates and 
phosphorylated sugars are abundant when cellular expressions of DHTKD1 and OGDH 
are comparable, while nicotinate and non-phosphorylated sugars are when DHTKD1 
expression is order(s) of magnitude lower than that of OGDH. Using succinyl, 
glutaryl and adipoyl phosphonates on the enzyme preparations from tissues with 
varied DHTKD1 expression reveals the contributions of OADH and OGDH to oxidation 
of 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate in vitro. In the phosphonates-treated cells 
with the high and low DHTKD1 expression, adipate or glutarate, correspondingly, 
are the most affected metabolites. The marker of fatty acid β-oxidation, 
adipate, is mostly decreased by the shorter, OGDH-preferring, phosphonate, in

Monocytes are bone marrow-derived leukocytes that are part of the innate immune 
system. Monocytes are divided into three subsets: classical, intermediate and 
non-classical, which can be differentiated by their expression of some surface 
antigens, mainly CD14 and CD16. These cells are key players in the inflammation 
process underlying the mechanism of many diseases. Thus, the molecular 
characterization of these cells may provide very useful information for 
understanding their biology in health and disease. We performed a multicentric 
proteomic study with pure classical and non-classical populations derived from 
12 healthy donors. The robust workflow used provided reproducible results among 
the five participating laboratories. Over 5000 proteins were identified, and 
about half of them were quantified using a spectral counting approach. The 
results represent the protein abundance catalogue of pure classical and enriched 
non-classical blood peripheral monocytes, and could serve as a reference dataset 
of the healthy population. The functional analysis of the differences between 
cell subsets supports the consensus roles assigned to human monocytes.

Greatwall-phosphorylated Endosulfine is both an inhibitor and a substrate of

During M phase, Endosulfine (Endos) family proteins are phosphorylated by 
Greatwall kinase (Gwl), and the resultant pEndos inhibits the phosphatase 
PP2A-B55, which would otherwise prematurely reverse many CDK-driven 
phosphorylations. We show here that PP2A-B55 is the enzyme responsible for 
dephosphorylating pEndos during M phase exit. The kinetic parameters for 
PP2A-B55's action on pEndos are orders of magnitude lower than those for 
CDK-phosphorylated substrates, suggesting a simple model for PP2A-B55 regulation 
that we call inhibition by unfair competition. As the name suggests, during M 
phase PP2A-B55's attention is diverted to pEndos, which binds much more avidly 
and is dephosphorylated more slowly than other substrates. When Gwl is 
inactivated during the M phase-to-interphase transition, the dynamic balance 
changes: pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 cannot be replaced, so the 
phosphatase can refocus its attention on CDK-phosphorylated substrates. This 
mechanism explains simultaneously how PP2A-B55 and Gwl together regulate pEndos, 
and how pEndos controls PP2A-B55. DOI:

In this series of reviews, we are examining ultrasensitive responses, the 
switch-like input-output relationships that contribute to signal processing in a 
wide variety of signaling contexts. In the first part of this series, we 
explored one mechanism for generating ultrasensitivity, zero-order 
ultrasensitivity, where the saturation of two converting enzymes allows the 
output to switch from low to high over a tight range of input levels. In this 
second installment, we focus on three conceptually distinct mechanisms for 
ultrasensitivity: multisite phosphorylation, stoichiometric inhibitors, and 
positive feedback. We also examine several related mechanisms and concepts, 
including cooperativity, reciprocal regulation, coherent feed-forward 
regulation, and substrate competition, and provide several examples of signaling 
processes where these mechanisms are known or are suspected to be applicable.

Mapping protein-protein interactions for chromatin-associated proteins remains 
challenging. Here we explore the use of BioID, a proximity biotinylation 
approach in which a mutated biotin ligase (BirA*) is fused to a bait of 
interest, allowing for the local activation of biotin and subsequent 
biotinylation of proteins in the bait vicinity. BioID allowed for successful 
interactome mapping of core histones and members of the mediator complex. We 
explored the background signal produced by the BioID approach and found that 
using distinct types of controls increased the stringency of our statistical 
analysis with SAINTexpress. A direct comparison of BioID with our AP-MS protocol 
optimized for chromatin-associated protein complexes revealed that the 
approaches identified few shared interaction partners and enriched for distinct 
biological processes; yet, both approaches permitted the recovery of 
biologically meaningful interactions. While no clear bias could be observed for 
either technique toward protein complexes of particular functions, BioID allowed 
for the purification of proteins of lower cellular abundance. Finally, we were 
able to identify a strong association of MED4 with the centrosome by BioID and 
validated this finding by immunofluorescence. In summary, BioID complements 
AP-MS for the study of chromatin-associated protein complexes.
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript describes the application of BioID, a 
proximity biotinylation approach, to chromatin-associated proteins, namely core 
histones and members of the mediator complex. We observed that BioID was 
successful at identifying known interaction partners for the baits tested, but 
also allowed novel putative interaction partners to be identified. By performing 
a detailed comparison of BioID versus a standard method for interactome mapping 
(affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry, AP-MS), we show that the 
approaches were complementary, allowing for purification of different 
interaction partners. These interaction partners were different in the 
biological processes they are associated with, but also in their abundance. 
BioID represents a significant technical development in the field of chromatin 
research by expanding the search space for interactome mapping beyond what is 
possible with AP-MS. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Protein 
dynamics in health and disease. Guest Editors: Pierre Thibault and Anne-Claude

The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a key conserved regulator of 
eukaryotic cell growth. The xenobiotic rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of the 
yeast complex. Surprisingly, the EGO complex, a nonessential in vivo activator 
of TORC1, is somehow required for yeast cells to recover efficiently from a 
period of treatment with rapamycin. Why? Here, we found that rapamycin is only a 
partial inhibitor of TORC1. We confirmed that saturating amounts of rapamycin do 
not fully inhibit proliferation of wild-type cells, and we found that the 
residual proliferation in the presence of the drug is dependent on the EGO 
complex and on the activity of TORC1. We found that this residual 
TORC1-dependent proliferation is key to recovery from rapamycin treatment. 
First, the residual proliferation rate correlates with the ability of cells to 
recover from treatment. Second, the residual proliferation rate persists long 
after washout of the drug and until cells recover. Third, the total observable 
pool of cell-associated rapamycin is extremely stable and decreases only with 
increasing cell number after washout of the drug. Finally, consideration of the 
residual proliferation rate alone accurately and quantitatively accounts for the 
kinetics of recovery of wild-type cells and for the nature and severity of the 
ego- mutant defect. Overall, our results revealed that rapamycin is a partial 
inhibitor of yeast TORC1, that persistence of the drug limits recovery, and that 
rapamycin is not detoxified by yeast but is passively diluted among progeny 
cells because of residual proliferation.

The various pathophysiological processes occurring in living systems are known 
to be orchestrated by delicate interplays and cross-talks between different 
genes and their regulators. Among the various regulators of genes, there is a 
class of small non-coding RNA molecules known as microRNAs. Although, the 
relative simplicity of miRNAs and their ability to modulate cellular processes 
make them attractive therapeutic candidates, their presence in large numbers 
make it challenging for experimental researchers to interpret the intricacies of 
the molecular processes they regulate. Most of the existing bioinformatic tools 
fail to address these challenges. Here, we present a new web resource 
'miRnalyze' that has been specifically designed to directly identify the 
putative regulation of cell signaling pathways by miRNAs. The tool integrates 
miRNA-target predictions with signaling cascade members by utilizing 
TargetScanHuman 7.1 miRNA-target prediction tool and the KEGG pathway database, 
and thus provides researchers with in-depth insights into modulation of signal 
transduction pathways by miRNAs. miRnalyze is capable of identifying common 
miRNAs targeting more than one gene in the same signaling pathway-a feature that 
further increases the probability of modulating the pathway and downstream 
reactions when using miRNA modulators. Additionally, miRnalyze can sort miRNAs 
according to the seed-match types and TargetScan Context ++ score, thus 
providing a hierarchical list of most valuable miRNAs. Furthermore, in order to 
provide users with comprehensive information regarding miRNAs, genes and 
pathways, miRnalyze also links to expression data of miRNAs (miRmine) and genes 
(TiGER) and proteome abundance (PaxDb) data. To validate the capability of the 
tool, we have documented the correlation of miRnalyze's prediction with 
experimental confirmation studies.

When proteostasis becomes unbalanced, unfolded proteins can accumulate and 
aggregate. Here we report that the dye, tetraphenylethene maleimide (TPE-MI) can 
be used to measure cellular unfolded protein load. TPE-MI fluorescence is 
activated upon labelling free cysteine thiols, normally buried in the core of 
globular proteins that are exposed upon unfolding. Crucially TPE-MI does not 
become fluorescent when conjugated to soluble glutathione. We find that TPE-MI 
fluorescence is enhanced upon reaction with cellular proteomes under conditions 
promoting accumulation of unfolded proteins. TPE-MI reactivity can be used to 
track which proteins expose more cysteine residues under stress through 
proteomic analysis. We show that TPE-MI can report imbalances in proteostasis in 
induced pluripotent stem cell models of Huntington disease, as well as cells 
transfected with mutant Huntington exon 1 before the formation of visible 
aggregates. TPE-MI also detects protein damage following dihydroartemisinin 
treatment of the malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum. TPE-MI therefore holds 
promise as a tool to probe proteostasis mechanisms in disease.Proteostasis is 
maintained through a number of molecular mechanisms, some of which function to 
protect the folded state of proteins. Here the authors demonstrate the use of 
TPE-MI in a fluorigenic dye assay for the quantitation of unfolded proteins that 
can be used to assess proteostasis on a cellular or proteome scale.

We applied 15N labeling approaches to leaves of the Arabidopsis thaliana rosette 
to characterize their protein degradation rate and understand its determinants. 
The progressive labeling of new peptides with 15N and measuring the decrease in 
the abundance of >60,000 existing peptides over time allowed us to define the 
degradation rate of 1228 proteins in vivo. We show that Arabidopsis protein 
half-lives vary from several hours to several months based on the exponential 
constant of the decay rate for each protein. This rate was calculated from the 
relative isotope abundance of each peptide and the fold change in protein 
abundance during growth. Protein complex membership and specific protein domains 
were found to be strong predictors of degradation rate, while N-end amino acid, 
hydrophobicity, or aggregation propensity of proteins were not. We discovered 
rapidly degrading subunits in a variety of protein complexes in plastids and 
identified the set of plant proteins whose degradation rate changed in different 
leaves of the rosette and correlated with leaf growth rate. From this 
information, we have calculated the protein turnover energy costs in different 
leaves and their key determinants within the proteome.

Although more and more entangled participants of translation process were 
realized, how they cooperate and co-determine the final translation efficiency 
still lacks details. Here, we reasoned that the basic translation components, 
tRNAs and amino acids should be consistent to maximize the efficiency and 
minimize the cost. We firstly revealed that 310 out of 410 investigated genomes 
of three domains had significant co-adaptions between the tRNA gene copy numbers 
and amino acid compositions, indicating that maximum efficiency constitutes 
ubiquitous selection pressure on protein translation. Furthermore, fast-growing 
and larger bacteria are found to have significantly better co-adaption and 
confirmed the effect of this pressure. Within organism, highly expressed 
proteins and those connected to acute responses have higher co-adaption 
intensity. Thus, the better co-adaption probably speeds up the growing of cells 
through accelerating the translation of special proteins. Experimentally, 
manipulating the tRNA gene copy number to optimize co-adaption between enhanced 
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and tRNA gene set of Escherichia coli indeed 
lifted the translation rate (speed). Finally, as a newly confirmed translation 
rate regulating mechanism, the co-adaption reflecting translation rate not only 
deepens our understanding on translation process but also provides an easy and 
practicable method to improve protein translation rates and productivity.

The proteome is a dynamic system in which each protein has interconnected 
properties - dimensions - that together contribute to the phenotype of a cell. 
Measuring these properties has proved challenging owing to their diversity and 
dynamic nature. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics now enable the 
measurement of multiple properties for thousands of proteins, including their 
abundance, isoform expression, turnover rate, subcellular localization, 
post-translational modifications and interactions. Complementing these 
experimental developments are new data analysis, integration and visualization 
tools as well as data-sharing resources. Together, these advances in the 
multidimensional analysis of the proteome are transforming our understanding of 
various cellular and physiological processes.

In eukaryotic cells, protein phosphorylation is an important and widespread 
mechanism used to regulate protein function. Yet, of the thousands of 
phosphosites identified to date, only a few hundred at best have a characterized 
function. It was recently shown that these functional sites are significantly 
more conserved than phosphosites of unknown function, stressing the importance 
of considering evolutionary conservation in assessing the global functional 
landscape of phosphosites. This leads us to review studies that examined the 
impact of phosphorylation on evolutionary conservation. While all these studies 
have shown that conservation is greater among phosphorylated sites compared with 
non-phosphorylated ones, the magnitude of this difference varies greatly. 
Further, not all studies have considered key factors that may influence the rate 
of phosphosite evolution. Such key factors are their localization in ordered or 
disordered regions, their stoichiometry or the abundance of their corresponding 
protein. Here we take into account all of these factors simultaneously, which 
reveals remarkable evolutionary patterns. First, while it is well established 
that protein conservation increases with abundance, we show that phosphosites 
partly follow an opposite trend. More precisely, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
phosphosites present among abundant proteins are 1.5 times more likely to 
diverge in the closely related species Saccharomyces bayanus when compared with 
phosphosites present in the 5 per cent least abundant proteins. Second, we show 
that conservation is coupled to stoichiometry, whereby sites frequently 
phosphorylated are more conserved than those rarely phosphorylated. Finally, we 
provide a model of functional and noisy or 'accidental' phosphorylation that 
explains these observations.

An understanding of the forces shaping protein conservation is key, both for the 
fundamental knowledge it represents and to allow for optimal use of evolutionary 
information in practical applications. Sequence conservation is typically 
examined at one of two levels. The first is a residue-level, where intra-protein 
differences are analyzed and the second is a protein-level, where inter-protein 
differences are studied. At a residue level, we know that solvent-accessibility 
is a prime determinant of conservation. By inverting this logic, we inferred 
that disordered regions are slightly more solvent-accessible on average than the 
most exposed surface residues in domains. By integrating abundance information 
with evolutionary data within and across proteins, we confirmed a previously 
reported strong surface-core association in the evolution of structured regions, 
but we found a comparatively weak association between disordered and structured 
regions. The facts that disordered and structured regions experience different 
structural constraints and evolve independently provide a unique setup to 
examine an outstanding question: why is a protein's abundance the main 
determinant of its sequence conservation? Indeed, any structural or biophysical 
property linked to the abundance-conservation relationship should increase the 
relative conservation of regions concerned with that property (e.g., disordered 
residues with mis-interactions, domain residues with misfolding). Surprisingly, 
however, we found the conservation of disordered and structured regions to 
increase in equal proportion with abundance. This observation implies that 
either abundance-related constraints are structure-independent, or multiple 
constraints apply to different regions and perfectly balance each other.

ISWI and CHD chromatin remodelers bind promoters but act in gene bodies.

ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers influence genetic processes by altering 
nucleosome occupancy, positioning, and composition. In vitro, Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae ISWI and CHD remodelers require ∼30-85 bp of extranucleosomal DNA to 
reposition nucleosomes, but linker DNA in S. cerevisiae averages <20 bp. To 
address this discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo observations, we have 
mapped the genomic distributions of the yeast Isw1, Isw2, and Chd1 remodelers at 
base-pair resolution on native chromatin. Although these remodelers act in gene 
bodies, we find that they are also highly enriched at nucleosome-depleted 
regions (NDRs), where they bind to extended regions of DNA adjacent to 
particular transcription factors. Surprisingly, catalytically inactive 
remodelers show similar binding patterns. We find that remodeler occupancy at 
NDRs and gene bodies is associated with nucleosome turnover and transcriptional 
elongation rate, suggesting that remodelers act on regions of transient 
nucleosome unwrapping or depletion within gene bodies subsequent to 
transcriptional elongation.

Independent effects of protein core size and expression on residue-level 
structure-evolution relationships.

States of America.

Recently, we demonstrated that yeast protein evolutionary rate at the level of 
individual amino acid residues scales linearly with degree of solvent 
accessibility. This residue-level structure-evolution relationship is sensitive 
to protein core size: surface residues from large-core proteins evolve much 
faster than those from small-core proteins, while buried residues are equally 
constrained independent of protein core size. In this work, we investigate the 
joint effects of protein core size and expression on the residue-level 
structure-evolution relationship. At the whole-protein level, protein expression 
is a much more dominant determinant of protein evolutionary rate than protein 
core size. In contrast, at the residue level, protein core size and expression 
both have major impacts on protein structure-evolution relationships. In 
addition, protein core size and expression influence residue-level 
structure-evolution relationships in qualitatively different ways. Protein core 
size preferentially affects the non-synonymous substitution rates of surface 
residues compared to buried residues, and has little influence on synonymous 
substitution rates. In comparison, protein expression uniformly affects all 
residues independent of degree of solvent accessibility, and affects both 
non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates. Protein core size and 
expression exert largely independent effects on protein evolution at the residue 
level, and can combine to produce dramatic changes in the slope of the linear 
relationship between residue evolutionary rate and solvent accessibility. Our 
residue-level findings demonstrate that protein core size and expression are 
both important, yet qualitatively different, determinants of protein evolution. 
These results underscore the complementary nature of residue-level and 
whole-protein analysis of protein evolution.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that is able to survive abnormally high 
levels of ionizing radiation (IR). The radiolysis of water by IR generates 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 and OH-. C. neoformans withstands the 
damage caused by IR and ROS through antioxidant production and enzyme-catalyzed 
breakdown of ROS. Given these particular cellular protein needs, questions arise 
whether transfer ribonucleic acids molecules (tRNAs) undergo unique chemical 
modifications to maintain their structure, stability, and/or function under such 
environmental conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of IR and H2O2 
exposure on tRNAs in C. neoformans. We experimentally identified the modified 
nucleosides present in C. neoformans tRNAs and quantified changes in those 
modifications upon exposure to oxidative conditions. To better understand these 
modified nucleoside results, we also evaluated tRNA pool composition in response 
to the oxidative conditions. We found that regardless of environmental 
conditions, tRNA modifications and transcripts were minimally affected. A 
rationale for the stability of the tRNA pool and its concomitant profile of 
modified nucleosides is proposed based on the lack of codon bias throughout the 
C. neoformans genome and in particular for oxidative response transcripts. Our 
findings suggest that C. neoformans can rapidly adapt to oxidative environments 
as mRNA translation/protein synthesis are minimally impacted by codon bias.

Eukaryotic translation initiation is a multistep process requiring a number of 
eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). Two GTPases play key roles in 
the process. eIF2 brings the initiator Met-tRNAi to the preinitiation complex 
(PIC). Upon start codon selection and GTP hydrolysis promoted by the 
GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF5, eIF2-GDP is displaced from Met-tRNAi by 
eIF5B-GTP and is released in complex with eIF5. eIF5B promotes ribosomal subunit 
joining, with the help of eIF1A. Upon subunit joining, eIF5B hydrolyzes GTP and 
is released together with eIF1A. We found that human eIF5 interacts with eIF5B 
and may help recruit eIF5B to the PIC. An eIF5B-binding motif was identified at 
the C-terminus of eIF5, similar to that found in eIF1A. Indeed, eIF5 competes 
with eIF1A for binding and has an ∼100-fold higher affinity for eIF5B. Because 
eIF5 is the GAP of eIF2, the newly discovered interaction offers a possible 
mechanism for coordination between the two steps in translation initiation 
controlled by GTPases: start codon selection and ribosomal subunit joining. Our 
results indicate that in humans, eIF5B displacing eIF2 from Met-tRNAi upon 
subunit joining may be coupled to eIF1A displacing eIF5 from eIF5B, allowing the 
eIF5:eIF2-GDP complex to leave the ribosome.

Low Complexity Regions in Mammalian Proteins are Associated with Low Protein 
Abundance and High Transcript Abundance.

Low Complexity Regions (LCRs) are present in a surprisingly large number of 
eukaryotic proteins. These highly repetitive and compositionally biased 
sequences are often structurally disordered, bind promiscuously, and evolve 
rapidly. Frequently studied in terms of evolutionary dynamics, little is known 
about how LCRs affect the expression of the proteins which contain them. It 
would be expected that rapidly evolving LCRs are unlikely to be tolerated in 
strongly conserved, highly abundant proteins, leading to lower overall abundance 
in proteins which contain LCRs. To test this hypothesis and examine the 
associations of protein abundance and transcript abundance with the presence of 
LCRs, we have integrated high-throughput data from across mammals. We have found 
that LCRs are indeed associated with reduced protein abundance, but are also 
associated with elevated transcript abundance. These associations are 
qualitatively consistent across 12 human tissues and nine mammalian species. The 
differential impacts of LCRs on abundance at the protein and transcript level 
are not explained by differences in either protein degradation rates or the 
inefficiency of translation for LCR containing proteins. We suggest that rapidly 
evolving LCRs are a source of selective pressure on the regulatory mechanisms 
which maintain steady-state protein abundance levels.

BACKGROUND: Two important challenges in the analysis of molecular biology 
information are data (multi-omic information) integration and the detection of 
patterns across large scale molecular networks and sequences. They are are 
actually coupled beause the integration of omic information may provide better 
means to detect multi-omic patterns that could reveal multi-scale or emerging 
properties at the phenotype levels.
RESULTS: Here we address the problem of integrating various types of molecular 
information (a large collection of gene expression and sequence data, codon 
usage and protein abundances) to analyse the E.coli metabolic response to 
treatments at the whole network level. Our algorithm, MORA (Multi-omic relations 
adjacency) is able to detect patterns which may represent metabolic network 
motifs at pathway and supra pathway levels which could hint at some functional 
role. We provide a description and insights on the algorithm by testing it on a 
large database of responses to antibiotics. Along with the algorithm MORA, a 
novel model for the analysis of oscillating multi-omics has been proposed. 
Interestingly, the resulting analysis suggests that some motifs reveal recurring 
oscillating or position variation patterns on multi-omics metabolic networks. 
Our framework, implemented in R, provides effective and friendly means to design 
intervention scenarios on real data. By analysing how multi-omics data build up 
multi-scale phenotypes, the software allows to compare and test metabolic 
models, design new pathways or redesign existing metabolic pathways and validate 
in silico metabolic models using nearby species.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of multi-omic data reveals that E.coli multi-omic 
metabolic networks contain position dependent and recurring patterns which could 
provide clues of long range correlations in the bacterial genome.

Most genes change expression levels across conditions, but it is unclear which 
of these changes represents specific regulation and what determines their 
quantitative degree. Here, we accurately measured activities of ~900 S. 
cerevisiae and ~1800 E. coli promoters using fluorescent reporters. We show that 
in both organisms 60-90% of promoters change their expression between conditions 
by a constant global scaling factor that depends only on the conditions and not 
on the promoter's identity. Quantifying such global effects allows precise 
characterization of specific regulation-promoters deviating from the global 
scale line. These are organized into few functionally related groups that also 
adhere to scale lines and preserve their relative activities across conditions. 
Thus, only several scaling factors suffice to accurately describe genome-wide 
expression profiles across conditions. We present a parameter-free passive 
resource allocation model that quantitatively accounts for the global scaling 
factors. It suggests that many changes in expression across conditions result 
from global effects and not specific regulation, and provides means for 
quantitative interpretation of expression profiles.

Through an impressive range of dynamic interactions, proteins succeed to carry 
out the majority of functions in a cell. These temporally and spatially 
regulated interactions provide the means through which one single protein can 
perform diverse functions and modulate different cellular pathways. 
Understanding the identity and nature of these interactions is therefore 
critical for defining protein functions and their contribution to health and 
disease processes. Here, we provide an overview of workflows that incorporate 
immunoaffinity purifications and quantitative mass spectrometry (frequently 
abbreviated as IP-MS or AP-MS) for characterizing protein-protein interactions. 
We discuss experimental aspects that should be considered when optimizing the 
isolation of a protein complex. As the presence of nonspecific associations is a 
concern in these experiments, we discuss the common sources of nonspecific 
interactions and present label-free and metabolic labeling mass 
spectrometry-based methods that can help determine the specificity of 
interactions. The effective regulation of cellular pathways and the rapid 
reaction to various environmental stresses rely on the formation of stable, 
transient, and fast-exchanging protein-protein interactions. While determining 
the exact nature of an interaction remains challenging, we review cross-linking 
and metabolic labeling approaches that can help address this important aspect of 
characterizing protein interactions and macromolecular assemblies.

The spontaneous degradation of asparaginyl and aspartyl residues to isoaspartyl 
residues is a common type of protein damage in aging organisms. Although the 
protein-l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) can 
initiate the repair of l-isoaspartyl residues to l-aspartyl residues in most 
organisms, no gene homolog or enzymatic activity is present in the budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, we used biochemical approaches to elucidate 
how proteins containing isoaspartyl residues are metabolized in this organism. 
Surprisingly, the level of isoaspartyl residues in yeast proteins (50-300 pmol 
of isoaspartyl residues/mg of protein extract) is comparable with organisms with 
protein-l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) O-methyltransferase, suggesting a novel 
regulatory pathway. Interfering with common protein quality control mechanisms 
by mutating and inhibiting the proteasomal and autophagic pathways in vivo did 
not increase isoaspartyl residue levels compared with wild type or uninhibited 
cells. However, the inhibition of metalloproteases in in vitro aging experiments 
by EDTA resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in the level of isoaspartyl-containing 
peptides. Characterization by mass spectrometry of these peptides identified 
several proteins involved in metabolism as targets of isoaspartyl damage. 
Further analysis of these peptides revealed that many have an N-terminal 
isoaspartyl site and originate from proteins with short half-lives. These 
results suggest that one or more metalloproteases participate in limiting 
isoaspartyl formation by robust proteolysis.

Human sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) catalyzes the conversion of H2S to 
thiosulfate, the first step in mammalian H2S metabolism. SQOR's inability to 
produce the glutathione persulfide (GSS(-)) substrate for sulfur dioxygenase 
(SDO) suggested that a thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase (TST) was 
required to provide the missing link between the SQOR and SDO reactions. 
Although TST could be purified from yeast, attempts to isolate the mammalian 
enzyme were not successful. We used bioinformatic approaches to identify genes 
likely to encode human TST (TSTD1) and its yeast ortholog (RDL1). Recombinant 
TSTD1 and RDL1 catalyze a predicted thiosulfate-dependent conversion of 
glutathione to GSS(-). Both enzymes contain a rhodanese homology domain and a 
single catalytically essential cysteine, which is converted to cysteine 
persulfide upon reaction with thiosulfate. GSS(-) is a potent inhibitor of TSTD1 
and RDL1, as judged by initial rate accelerations and ≥25-fold lower Km values 
for glutathione observed in the presence of SDO. The combined action of GSS(-) 
and SDO is likely to regulate the biosynthesis of the reactive metabolite. SDO 
drives to completion p-toluenethiosulfonate:glutathione sulfurtransferase 
reactions catalyzed by TSTD1 and RDL1. The thermodynamic coupling of the 
irreversible SDO and reversible TST reactions provides a model for the 
physiologically relevant reaction with thiosulfate as the sulfane donor. The 
discovery of bacterial Rosetta Stone proteins that comprise fusions of SDO and 
TSTD1 provides phylogenetic evidence of the association of these enzymes. The 
presence of adjacent bacterial genes encoding SDO-TSTD1 fusion proteins and 
human-like SQORs suggests these prokaryotes and mammals exhibit strikingly 
similar pathways for H2S metabolism.

The ability of chaperonins to buffer mutations that affect protein folding 
pathways suggests that their abundance should be evolutionarily advantageous. 
Here, we investigate the effect of chaperonin overproduction on cellular fitness 
in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that chaperonin abundance confers 1) an 
ability to tolerate higher temperatures, 2) improved cellular fitness, and 3) 
enhanced folding of metabolic enzymes, which is expected to lead to enhanced 
energy harvesting potential.

models for a systems-level exploration of disease mechanisms, drug development 
and replacement of animal models. Using an ensemble modelling strategy, we 
developed a computational model of the AA cascade. This approach allows the 
visualisation of plausible and thermodynamically feasible predictions, 
overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter modelling. A quality scoring 
method was developed to quantify the accuracy of ensemble predictions relative 
to experimental data, measuring the overall uncertainty of the process. Monte 
Carlo ensemble modelling was used to quantify the prediction confidence levels. 
Model applicability was demonstrated using mass spectrometry mediator lipidomics 
to measure eicosanoids produced by HaCaT epidermal keratinocytes and 46BR.1N 
dermal fibroblasts, treated with stimuli (calcium ionophore A23187), 
(ultraviolet radiation, adenosine triphosphate) and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor 
(indomethacin). Experimentation and predictions were in good qualitative 
agreement, demonstrating the ability of the model to be adapted to cell types 
exhibiting differences in AA release and enzyme concentration profiles. The 
quantitative agreement between experimental and predicted outputs could be 
improved by expanding network topology to include additional reactions. Overall, 
our approach generated an adaptable, tuneable ensemble model of the AA cascade 
that can be tailored to represent different cell types and demonstrated that the 
integration of in silico and in vitro methods can facilitate a greater 
understanding of complex biological networks such as the AA cascade.

Intermediary metabolism provides living cells with free energy and precursor 
metabolites required for synthesizing proteins, lipids, RNA and other cellular 
constituents, and it is highly conserved among living species. Only a fraction 
of cellular protein can, however, be allocated to enzymes of intermediary 
metabolism and consequently metabolic trade-offs may take place. One such 
trade-off, aerobic fermentation, occurs in both yeast (the Crabtree effect) and 
cancer cells (the Warburg effect) and has been a scientific challenge for 
decades. Here we show, using flux balance analysis combined with in vitro 
measured enzyme specific activities, that fermentation is more catalytically 
efficient than respiration, i.e. it produces more ATP per protein mass. And that 
the switch to fermentation at high growth rates therefore is a consequence of a 
high ATP production rate, provided by a limited pool of enzymes. The catalytic 
efficiency is also higher for cells grown on glucose compared to galactose and 
ethanol, which may explain the observed differences in their growth rates. The 
enzyme F1F0-ATP synthase (Complex V) was found to have flux control over 
respiration in the model, and since it is evolutionary conserved, we expect the 
trade-off to occur in organisms from all kingdoms of life.

Proteomics techniques generate an avalanche of data and promise to satisfy 
biologists' long-held desire to measure absolute protein abundances on a 
genome-wide scale. However, can this knowledge be translated into a clearer 
picture of how cells invest their protein resources? This article aims to give a 
broad perspective on the composition of proteomes as gleaned from recent 
quantitative proteomics studies. We describe proteomaps, an approach for 
visualizing the composition of proteomes with a focus on protein abundances and 
functions. In proteomaps, each protein is shown as a polygon-shaped tile, with 
an area representing protein abundance. Functionally related proteins appear in 
adjacent regions. General trends in proteomes, such as the dominance of 
metabolism and protein production, become easily visible. We make interactive 
visualizations of published proteome datasets accessible at www.proteomaps.net. 
We suggest that evaluating the way protein resources are allocated by various 
organisms and cell types in different conditions will sharpen our understanding 
of how and why cells regulate the composition of their proteomes.

Proteins are necessary for cellular growth. Concurrently, however, protein 
production has high energetic demands associated with transcription and 
translation. Here, we propose that activity of molecular chaperones shape 
protein burden, that is the fitness costs associated with expression of unneeded 
proteins. To test this hypothesis, we performed a genome-wide genetic 
interaction screen in baker's yeast. Impairment of transcription, translation, 
and protein folding rendered cells hypersensitive to protein burden. 
Specifically, deletion of specific regulators of the Hsp70-associated chaperone 
network increased protein burden. In agreement with expectation, temperature 
stress, increased mistranslation and a chemical misfolding agent all 
substantially enhanced protein burden. Finally, unneeded protein perturbed 
interactions between key components of the Hsp70-Hsp90 network involved in 
folding of native proteins. We conclude that specific chaperones contribute to 
protein burden. Our work indicates that by minimizing the damaging impact of 
gratuitous protein overproduction, chaperones enable tolerance to massive 
changes in genomic expression.

Under stress, certain eukaryotic proteins and RNA assemble to form membraneless 
organelles known as stress granules. The most well-studied stress granule 
components are RNA-binding proteins that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) into protein-rich droplets mediated by intrinsically disordered 
low-complexity domains (LCDs). Here we show that stress granules include 
proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN2, an LCD-containing protein structurally and 
functionally distinct from RNA-binding proteins. In vitro, UBQLN2 exhibits LLPS 
at physiological conditions. Deletion studies correlate oligomerization with 
UBQLN2's ability to phase-separate and form stress-induced cytoplasmic puncta in 
cells. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we mapped weak, 
multivalent interactions that promote UBQLN2 oligomerization and LLPS. Ubiquitin 
or polyubiquitin binding, obligatory for UBQLN2's biological functions, 
eliminates UBQLN2 LLPS, thus serving as a switch between droplet and disperse 
phases. We postulate that UBQLN2 LLPS enables its recruitment to stress 
granules, where its interactions with ubiquitinated substrates reverse LLPS to 
enable shuttling of clients out of stress granules.

With the sensitivity enhancements conferred by dynamic nuclear polarization 
(DNP), magic angle spinning (MAS) solid state NMR spectroscopy experiments can 
attain the necessary sensitivity to detect very low concentrations of proteins. 
This potentially enables structural investigations of proteins at their 
endogenous levels in their biological contexts where their native 
stoichiometries with potential interactors is maintained. Yet, even with DNP, 
experiments are still sensitivity limited. Moreover, when an 
isotopically-enriched target protein is present at physiological levels, which 
typically range from low micromolar to nanomolar concentrations, the isotope 
content from the natural abundance isotopes in the cellular milieu can outnumber 
the isotope content of the target protein. Using isotopically enriched yeast 
prion protein, Sup35NM, diluted into natural abundance yeast lysates, we 
optimized sample composition. We found that modest cryoprotectant concentrations 
and fully protonated environments support efficient DNP. We experimentally 
validated theoretical calculations of the limit of specificity for an 
isotopically enriched protein in natural abundance cellular milieu. We establish 
that, using pulse sequences that are selective for adjacent NMR-active nuclei, 
proteins can be specifically detected in cellular milieu at concentrations in 
the hundreds of nanomolar. Finally, we find that maintaining native 
stoichiometries of the protein of interest to the components of the cellular 
environment may be important for proteins that make specific interactions with 
cellular constituents.

We aimed to comprehensively compare two compartmented oral proteomes, the 
salivary and the dental pellicle proteome. Systematic review and datamining was 
used to obtain the physico-chemical, structural, functional and interactional 
properties of 1,515 salivary and 60 identified pellicle proteins. Salivary and 
pellicle proteins did not differ significantly in their aliphatic index, 
hydrophaty, instability index, or isoelectric point. Pellicle proteins were 
significantly more charged at low and high pH and were significantly smaller 
(10-20 kDa) than salivary proteins. Protein structure and solvent accessible 
molecular surface did not differ significantly. Proteins of the pellicle were 
more phosphorylated and glycosylated than salivary proteins. Ion binding and 
enzymatic activities also differed significantly. Protein-protein-ligand 
interaction networks relied on few key proteins. The identified differences 
between salivary and pellicle proteins could guide proteome compartmentalization 
and result in specialized functionality. Key proteins could be potential targets 
for diagnostic or therapeutic application.

Thrombosis, like other cardiovascular diseases, has a strong genetic component, 
with largely unknown determinants. EMILIN2, Elastin Microfibril Interface 
Located Protein2, was identified as a candidate gene for thrombosis in mouse and 
human quantitative trait loci studies. EMILIN2 is expressed during 
cardiovascular development, on cardiac stem cells, and in heart tissue in animal 
models of heart disease. In humans, the EMILIN2 gene is located on the short arm 
of Chromosome 18, and patients with partial and complete deletion of this 
chromosome region have cardiac malformations. To understand the basis for the 
thrombotic risk associated with EMILIN2, EMILIN2 deficient mice were generated. 
The findings of this study indicate that EMILIN2 influences platelet aggregation 
induced by adenosine diphosphate, collagen, and thrombin with both 
EMILIN2-deficient platelets and EMILIN2-deficient plasma contributing to the 
impaired aggregation response. Purified EMILIN2 added to platelets accelerated 
platelet aggregation and reduced clotting time when added to EMILIN2-deficient 
mouse and human plasma. Carotid occlusion time was 2-fold longer in mice with 
platelet-specific EMILIN2 deficiency, but stability of the clot was reduced in 
mice with both global EMILIN2 deficiency and with platelet-specific EMILIN2 
deficiency. In vitro clot retraction was markedly decreased in EMILIN2 deficient 
mice, indicating that platelet outside-in signaling was dependent on EMILIN2. 
EMILIN1 deficient mice and EMILIN2:EMILIN1 double deficient mice had suppressed 
platelet aggregation and delayed clot retraction similar to EMILIN2 mice, but 
EMILIN2 and EMILIN1 had opposing affects on clot retraction, suggesting that 
EMILIN1 may attenuate the effects of EMILIN2 on platelet aggregation and 
thrombosis. In conclusion, these studies identify multiple influences of EMILIN2 
in pathophysiology and suggest that its role as a prothrombotic risk factor may 
arise from its effects on platelet aggregation and platelet mediated clot 
retraction.

Proteolysis is a critical post-translational modification for regulation of 
cellular processes. Our lab has previously developed a technique for 
specifically labeling unmodified protein N termini, the α-aminome, using the 
engineered enzyme, subtiligase. Here we present a database, called the DegraBase 
(http://wellslab.ucsf.edu/degrabase/), which compiles 8090 unique N termini from 
3206 proteins directly identified in subtiligase-based positive enrichment mass 
spectrometry experiments in healthy and apoptotic human cell lines. We include 
both previously published and unpublished data in our analysis, resulting in a 
total of 2144 unique α-amines identified in healthy cells, and 6990 in cells 
undergoing apoptosis. The N termini derive from three general categories of 
proteolysis with respect to cleavage location and functional role: translational 
N-terminal methionine processing (∼10% of total proteolysis), sites close to the 
translational N terminus that likely represent removal of transit or signal 
peptides (∼25% of total), and finally, other endoproteolytic cuts (∼65% of 
total). Induction of apoptosis causes relatively little change in the first two 
proteolytic categories, but dramatic changes are seen in endoproteolysis. For 
example, we observed 1706 putative apoptotic caspase cuts, more than double the 
total annotated sites in the CASBAH and MEROPS databases. In the endoproteolysis 
category, there are a total of nearly 3000 noncaspase nontryptic cleavages that 
are not currently reported in the MEROPS database. These studies significantly 
increase the annotation for all categories of proteolysis in human cells and 
allow public access for investigators to explore interesting proteolytic events 
in healthy and apoptotic human cells.

Deducing generic causal relations between RNA transcript features and protein 
expression profiles from endogenous gene expression data remains a major 
unsolved problem in biology. The analysis of gene expression from heterologous 
genes contributes significantly to solving this problem, but has been heavily 
biased toward the study of the effect of 5' transcript regions and to 
prokaryotes. Here, we employ a synthetic biology driven approach that 
systematically differentiates the effect of different regions of the transcript 
on gene expression up to 240 nucleotides into the ORF. This enabled us to 
discover new causal effects between features in previously unexplored regions of 
transcripts, and gene expression in natural regimes. We rationally designed, 
constructed, and analyzed 383 gene variants of the viral HRSVgp04 gene ORF, with 
multiple synonymous mutations at key positions along the transcript in the 
eukaryote S. cerevisiae. Our results show that a few silent mutations at the 
5'UTR can have a dramatic effect of up to 15 fold change on protein levels, and 
that even synonymous mutations in positions more than 120 nucleotides downstream 
from the ORF 5'end can modulate protein levels up to 160%-300%. We demonstrate 
that the correlation between protein levels and folding energy increases with 
the significance of the level of selection of the latter in endogenous genes, 
reinforcing the notion that selection for folding strength in different parts of 
the ORF is related to translation regulation. Our measured protein abundance 
correlates notably(correlation up to r = 0.62 (p=0.0013)) with mean relative 
codon decoding times, based on ribosomal densities (Ribo-Seq) in endogenous 
genes, supporting the conjecture that translation elongation and adaptation to 
the tRNA pool can modify protein levels in a causal/direct manner. This report 
provides an improved understanding of transcript evolution, design principles of 
gene expression regulation, and suggests simple rules for engineering synthetic 
gene expression in eukaryotes.

Interindividual variability in platelet aggregation is common among patients 
treated with clopidogrel and both high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) 
and low on-treatment platelet reactivity (LTPR) increase risks for adverse 
clinical outcomes. CYP2C19 influences clopidogrel response but only accounts for 
∼12% of the variability in platelet reactivity. To identify novel variants 
implicated in on-treatment platelet reactivity, patients with coronary artery 
disease (CAD) with extreme pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel and 
wild-type CYP2C19 were subjected to exome sequencing. Candidate variants that 
clustered in the LTPR subgroup subsequently were genotyped across the discovery 
cohort (n = 636). Importantly, carriers of B4GALT2 c.909C>T had lower 
on-treatment P2Y12 reaction units (PRUs; P = 0.0077) and residual platelet 
aggregation (P = 0.0008) compared with noncarriers, which remained significant 
after adjusting for CYP2C19 and other clinical variables in both the discovery 
(P = 0.0298) and replication (n = 160; PRU: P = 0.0001) cohorts. B4GALT2 is a 
platelet-expressed galactosyltransferase, indicating that B4GALT2 c.909C>T may 
influence clopidogrel sensitivity through atypical cell-surface glycoprotein 
processing and platelet adhesion.

Switch-like behaviours in biochemical networks are of fundamental significance 
in biological signal processing, and exist as two distinct types: 
ultra-sensitivity and bistability. Here we propose two new models of a 
reversible covalent-modification cycle with positive autoregulation (PAR), a 
motif structure that is thought to be capable of both ultrasensitivity and 
bistability in different parameter regimes. These new models appeal to a 
modelling framework that we call complex-complete, which accounts fully for the 
molecular complexities of the underlying signalling mechanisms. Each of the two 
new models encodes a specific molecular mechanism for PAR. We demonstrate that 
the modelling simplifications for PAR models that have been used in previous 
work, which rely on Michaelian approximations, are unable to accurately 
recapitulate the qualitative signalling responses supported by our detailed 
models. Strikingly, we show that complex-complete PAR models are capable of new 
qualitative responses such as one-way switches and a 'prozone' effect, depending 
on the specific PAR-encoding mechanism, which are not supported by Michaelian 
simplifications. Our results highlight the critical importance of accurately 
representing the molecular details of biochemical signalling mechanisms, and 
strongly suggest that the Michaelian approximation is inadequate for predictive 
models of enzyme-mediated chemical reactions with added regulations such as PAR.

Modern tandem MS-based sequencing technologies allow for the parallel 
measurement of concentration and covalent modifications for proteins within a 
complex sample. Recently, this capability has been extended to probe a 
proteome's three-dimensional structure and conformational state by determining 
the thermal denaturation profile of thousands of proteins simultaneously. 
Although many animals and their resident microbes exist under a relatively 
narrow, regulated physiological temperature range, plants take on the often 
widely ranging temperature of their surroundings, possibly influencing the 
evolution of protein thermal stability. In this report we present the first 
in-depth look at the thermal proteome of a plant species, the model organism 
Arabidopsis thaliana By profiling the melting curves of over 1700 Arabidopsis 
proteins using six biological replicates, we have observed significant 
correlation between protein thermostability and several known protein 
characteristics, including molecular weight and the composition ratio of charged 
to polar amino acids. We also report on a divergence of the thermostability of 
the core and regulatory domains of the plant 26S proteasome that may reflect a 
unique property of the way protein turnover is regulated during temperature 
stress. Lastly, the highly replicated database of Arabidopsis melting 
temperatures reported herein provides baseline data on the variability of 
protein behavior in the assay. Unfolding behavior and experiment-to-experiment 
variability were observed to be protein-specific traits, and thus this data can 
serve to inform the design and interpretation of future targeted assays to probe 
the conformational status of proteins from plants exposed to different chemical, 
environmental and genetic challenges.

Multi-omics data-driven scientific discovery crucially rests on high-throughput 
technologies and data sharing. Currently, data are scattered across single omics 
repositories, stored in varying raw and processed formats, and are often 
accompanied by limited or no metadata. The Multi-Omics Profiling Expression 
Database (MOPED, http://moped.proteinspire.org ) version 2.5 is a freely 
accessible multi-omics expression database. Continual improvement and expansion 
of MOPED is driven by feedback from the Life Sciences Community. In order to 
meet the emergent need for an integrated multi-omics data resource, MOPED 2.5 
now includes gene relative expression data in addition to protein absolute and 
relative expression data from over 250 large-scale experiments. To facilitate 
accurate integration of experiments and increase reproducibility, MOPED provides 
extensive metadata through the Data-Enabled Life Sciences Alliance (DELSA 
Global, http://delsaglobal.org ) metadata checklist. MOPED 2.5 has greatly 
increased the number of proteomics absolute and relative expression records to 
over 500,000, in addition to adding more than four million transcriptomics 
relative expression records. MOPED has an intuitive user interface with tabs for 
querying different types of omics expression data and new tools for data 
visualization. Summary information including expression data, pathway mappings, 
and direct connection between proteins and genes can be viewed on Protein and 
Gene Details pages. These connections in MOPED provide a context for multi-omics 
expression data exploration. Researchers are encouraged to submit omics data 
which will be consistently processed into expression summaries. MOPED as a 
multi-omics data resource is a pivotal public database, interdisciplinary 
knowledge resource, and platform for multi-omics understanding.

It is known that many chemotherapeutics induce cellular apoptosis over hours to 
days. During apoptosis, numerous cellular proteases are activated, most 
canonically the caspases. We speculated that detection of proteolytic fragments 
released from apoptotic cells into the peripheral blood may serve as a unique 
indicator of chemotherapy-induced cell death. Here we used an enzymatic labeling 
process to positively enrich free peptide α-amines in the plasma of hematologic 
malignancy patients soon after beginning treatment. This N-terminomic approach 
largely avoids interference by high-abundance proteins that complicate 
traditional plasma proteomic analyses. Significantly, by mass spectrometry 
methods, we found strong biological signatures of apoptosis directly in the 
postchemotherapy plasma, including numerous caspase-cleaved peptides as well as 
relevant peptides from apoptotic and cell-stress proteins second 
mitochondria-derived activator of caspases, HtrA serine peptidase 2, and 
activating transcription factor 6. We also treated hematologic cancer cell lines 
with clinically relevant chemotherapeutics and monitored proteolytic fragments 
released into the media. Remarkably, many of these peptides coincided with those 
found in patient samples. Overall, we identified 153 proteolytic peptides in 
postchemotherapy patient plasma as potential indicators of cellular apoptosis. 
Through targeted quantitative proteomics, we verified that many of these 
peptides were indeed increased post- vs. prechemotherapy in additional patients. 
Our findings reveal that numerous proteolytic fragments are released from dying 
tumor cells. Monitoring posttreatment proteolysis may lead to a novel class of 
inexpensive, rapid biomarkers of cell death.

Initial pollen-pistil interactions in the Brassicaceae are regulated by rapid 
communication between pollen grains and stigmatic papillae and are fundamentally 
important, as they are the first step toward successful fertilization. The goal 
of this study was to examine the requirement of exocyst subunits, which function 
in docking secretory vesicles to sites of polarized secretion, in the context of 
pollen-pistil interactions. One of the exocyst subunit genes, EXO70A1, was 
previously identified as an essential factor in the stigma for the acceptance of 
compatible pollen in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and Brassica napus. We 
hypothesized that EXO70A1, along with other exocyst subunits, functions in the 
Brassicaceae dry stigma to deliver cargo-bearing secretory vesicles to the 
stigmatic papillar plasma membrane, under the pollen attachment site, for pollen 
hydration and pollen tube entry. Here, we investigated the functions of exocyst 
complex genes encoding the remaining seven subunits, SECRETORY3 (SEC3), SEC5, 
SEC6, SEC8, SEC10, SEC15, and EXO84, in Arabidopsis stigmas following compatible 
pollinations. Stigma-specific RNA-silencing constructs were used to suppress the 
expression of each exocyst subunit individually. The early postpollination 
stages of pollen grain adhesion, pollen hydration, pollen tube penetration, seed 
set, and overall fertility were analyzed in the transgenic lines to evaluate the 
requirement of each exocyst subunit. Our findings provide comprehensive evidence 
that all eight exocyst subunits are necessary in the stigma for the acceptance 
of compatible pollen. Thus, this work implicates a fully functional exocyst 
complex as a component of the compatible pollen response pathway to promote 
pollen acceptance.

Coenzyme A (CoA) is an ubiquitous and essential cofactor, synthesized from the 
precursor pantothenate. Vitamin biosynthetic pathways are normally tightly 
regulated, including the pathway from pantothenate to CoA. However, no 
regulation of pantothenate biosynthesis has been identified. We have recently 
described an additional component in the pantothenate biosynthetic pathway, 
PanZ, which promotes the activation of the zymogen, PanD, to form aspartate 
α-decarboxylase (ADC) in a CoA-dependent manner. Here we report the structure of 
PanZ in complex with PanD, which reveals the structural basis for the CoA 
dependence of this interaction and activation. In addition, we show that PanZ 
acts as a CoA-dependent inhibitor of ADC catalysis. This inhibitory effect can 
effectively regulate the biosynthetic pathway to pantothenate, and thereby also 
regulate CoA biosynthesis. This represents a previously unobserved mode of 
metabolic regulation whereby a cofactor-utilizing protein negatively regulates 
the biosynthesis of the same cofactor.

With the increased focus on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their 
large interactomes, the question about their specificity - or more so on their 
multispecificity - arise. Here we recapitulate how specificity and 
multispecificity are quantified and address through examples if IDPs in this 
respect differ from globular proteins. The conclusion is that quantitatively, 
globular proteins and IDPs are similar when it comes to specificity. However, 
compared with globular proteins, IDPs have larger interactome sizes, a 
phenomenon that is further enabled by their flexibility, repetitive binding 
motifs and propensity to adapt to different binding partners. For IDPs, this 
adaptability, interactome size and a higher degree of multivalency opens for new 
interaction mechanisms such as facilitated exchange through trimer formation and 
ultra-sensitivity via threshold effects and ensemble redistribution. IDPs and 
their interactions, thus, do not compromise the definition of specificity. 
Instead, it is the sheer size of their interactomes that complicates its 
calculation. More importantly, it is this size that challenges how we 
conceptually envision, interpret and speak about their specificity.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation (DNAm) has important regulatory roles in many 
biological processes and diseases. It is the only epigenetic mark with a clear 
mechanism of mitotic inheritance and the only one easily available on a genome 
scale. Aberrant cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation has been discussed 
in the context of disease aetiology, especially cancer. CpG hypermethylation of 
promoter regions is often associated with silencing of tumour suppressor genes 
and hypomethylation with activation of oncogenes.Supervised principal component 
analysis (SPCA) is a popular machine learning method. However, in a recent 
application to phenotype prediction from DNAm data SPCA was inferior to the 
specific method EVORA.
RESULTS: We present Model-Selection-SPCA (MS-SPCA), an enhanced version of SPCA. 
MS-SPCA applies several models that perform well in the training data to the 
test data and selects the very best models for final prediction based on 
parameters of the test data.We have applied MS-SPCA for phenotype prediction 
from genome-wide DNAm data. CpGs used for prediction are selected based on the 
quantification of three features of their methylation (average methylation 
difference, methylation variation difference and methylation-age-correlation). 
We analysed four independent case-control datasets that correspond to different 
stages of cervical cancer: (i) cases currently cytologically normal, but will 
later develop neoplastic transformations, (ii, iii) cases showing neoplastic 
transformations and (iv) cases with confirmed cancer. The first dataset was 
split into several smaller case-control datasets (samples either Human Papilloma 
Virus (HPV) positive or negative). We demonstrate that cytology normal HPV+ and 
HPV- samples contain DNAm patterns which are associated with later neoplastic 
transformations. We present evidence that DNAm patterns exist in cytology normal 
HPV- samples that (i) predispose to neoplastic transformations after HPV 
infection and (ii) predispose to HPV infection itself. MS-SPCA performs 
significantly better than EVORA.
CONCLUSIONS: MS-SPCA can be applied to many classification problems. Additional 
improvements could include usage of more than one principal component (PC), with 
automatic selection of the optimal number of PCs. We expect that MS-SPCA will be 
useful for analysing recent larger DNAm data to predict future neoplastic 
transformations.

Model-informed drug discovery advocates the use of mathematical modeling and 
simulation for improved efficacy in drug discovery. In the case of monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) against cell membrane antigens, this requires quantitative 
insight into the target tissue concentration levels. Protein mass spectrometry 
data are often available but the values are expressed in relative, rather than 
in molar concentration units that are easier to incorporate into pharmacokinetic 
models. Here, we present an empirical correlation that converts the parts per 
million (ppm) concentrations in the PaxDb database to their molar equivalents 
that are more suitable for pharmacokinetic modeling. We evaluate the insight 
afforded to target tissue distribution by analyzing the likely tumor-targeting 
accuracy of mAbs recognizing either epidermal growth factor receptor or its 
homolog HER2. Surprisingly, the predicted tissue concentrations of both these 
targets exceed the Kd values of their respective therapeutic mAbs. 
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling indicates that in these 
conditions only about 0.05% of the dosed mAb is likely to reach the solid tumor 
target cells. The rest of the dose is eliminated in healthy tissues via both 
nonspecific and target-mediated processes. The presented approach allows 
evaluation of the interplay between the target expression level in different 
tissues that determines the overall pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and 
the fraction that reaches the cells of interest. This methodology can help to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety properties of novel drugs, especially if the 
off-target cell degradation has cytotoxic outcomes, as in the case of 
antibody-drug conjugates.

In human spermatozoa, calcium dynamics control most of fertilization events. 
Progesterone, present in the female reproductive system, can trigger several 
types of calcium responses, such as low-frequency oscillations. Here we aimed to 
identify the mechanisms of progesterone-induced calcium signaling in human 
spermatozoa. Progesterone-induced activation of fluorophore-loaded spermatozoa 
was studied by fluorescent microscopy. Two computational models were developed 
to describe the spermatozoa calcium responses: a homogeneous one based on a 
system of ordinary differential equations and a three-dimensional one with added 
space dimensions and diffusion for the cytosolic species. In response to 
progesterone, three types of calcium responses were observed in human 
spermatozoa: a single transient rise of calcium concentration in cytosol, a 
steady elevation, or low-frequency oscillations. The homogenous model provided 
qualitative description of the oscillatory and the single spike responses, while 
the three-dimensional model captured the calcium peak shape and the frequency of 
calcium oscillations. The model analysis demonstrated that an increase in the 
calcium diffusion coefficient resulted in the disappearance of the calcium 
oscillations. Additionally, in silico analysis suggested that the spatial 
distribution of calcium signaling enzymes governs the appearance of calcium 
oscillations in progesterone-activated human spermatozoa.

Complex traits, including common disease-related traits, are affected by many 
different genes that function in multiple pathways and networks. The apoptosis, 
MAPK, Notch, and Wnt signalling pathways play important roles in development and 
disease progression. At the moment we have a poor understanding of how allelic 
variation affects gene expression in these pathways at the level of translation. 
Here we report the effect of natural genetic variation on transcript and protein 
abundance involved in developmental signalling pathways in Caenorhabditis 
elegans. We used selected reaction monitoring to analyse proteins from the 
abovementioned four pathways in a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) 
generated from the wild-type strains N2 (Bristol) and CB4856 (Hawaii) to enable 
quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. About half of the cases from the 44 
genes tested showed a statistically significant change in protein abundance 
between various strains, most of these were however very weak (below 1.3-fold 
change). We detected a distant QTL on the left arm of chromosome II that 
affected protein abundance of the phosphatidylserine receptor protein PSR-1, and 
two separate QTLs that influenced embryonic and ionizing radiation-induced 
apoptosis on chromosome IV. Our results demonstrate that natural variation in C. 
elegans is sufficient to cause significant changes in signalling pathways both 
at the gene expression (transcript and protein abundance) and phenotypic levels.

BACKGROUND: Large sets of protein-protein interaction data coming either from 
biological experiments or predictive methods are available and can be combined 
to construct networks from which information about various cell processes can be 
extracted. We have developed an in silico approach based on these information to 
model the biogenesis of multiprotein complexes in the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae.
RESULTS: Firstly, we have built three protein interaction networks by collecting 
the protein-protein interactions, which involved the subunits of three 
complexes, from different databases. The protein-protein interactions come from 
different kinds of biological experiments or are predicted. We have chosen the 
elongator and the mediator head complexes that are soluble and exhibit an 
architecture with subcomplexes that could be functional modules, and the 
mitochondrial bc 1 complex, which is an integral membrane complex and for which 
a late assembly subcomplex has been described. Secondly, by applying a 
clustering strategy to these networks, we were able to identify subcomplexes 
involved in the biogenesis of the complexes as well as the proteins interacting 
with each subcomplex. Thirdly, in order to validate our in silico results for 
the cytochrome bc1 complex we have analysed the physical interactions existing 
between three subunits by performing immunoprecipitation experiments in several 
genetic context.
CONCLUSIONS: For the two soluble complexes (the elongator and mediator head), 
our model shows a strong clustering of subunits that belong to a known 
subcomplex or module. For the membrane bc 1 complex, our approach has suggested 
new interactions between subunits in the early steps of the assembly pathway

Many cellular functions are mediated by protein-protein interaction networks, 
which are environment dependent. However, systematic measurement of interactions 
in diverse environments is required to better understand the relative importance 
of different mechanisms underlying network dynamics. To investigate 
environment-dependent protein complex dynamics, we used a DNA-barcode-based 
multiplexed protein interaction assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to measure 
in vivo abundance of 1,379 binary protein complexes under 14 environments. Many 
binary complexes (55%) were environment dependent, especially those involving 
transmembrane transporters. We observed many concerted changes around highly 
connected proteins, and overall network dynamics suggested that "concerted" 
protein-centered changes are prevalent. Under a diauxic shift in carbon source 
from glucose to ethanol, a mass-action-based model using relative mRNA levels 
explained an estimated 47% of the observed variance in binary complex abundance 
and predicted the direction of concerted binary complex changes with 88% 
accuracy. Thus, we provide a resource of yeast protein interaction measurements 
across diverse environments and illustrate the value of this resource in 
revealing mechanisms of network dynamics.

Protein phosphorylation underlies cellular response pathways across eukaryotes 
and is governed by the opposing actions of phosphorylating kinases and 
de-phosphorylating phosphatases. While kinases and phosphatases have been 
extensively studied, their organization and the mechanisms by which they balance 
each other are not well understood. To address these questions we performed 
quantitative analyses of large-scale 'omics' datasets from yeast, fly, plant, 
mouse and human. We uncovered an asymmetric balance of a previously-hidden 
scale: Each organism contained many different kinase genes, and these were 
balanced by a small set of highly abundant phosphatase proteins. Kinases were 
much more responsive to perturbations at the gene and protein levels. In 
addition, kinases had diverse scales of phenotypic impact when manipulated. 
Phosphatases, in contrast, were stable, highly robust and flatly organized, with 
rather uniform impact downstream. We validated aspects of this organization 
experimentally in nematode, and supported additional aspects by theoretic 
analysis of the dynamics of protein phosphorylation. Our analyses explain the 
empirical bias in the protein phosphorylation field toward characterization and 
therapeutic targeting of kinases at the expense of phosphatases. We show 
quantitatively and broadly that this is not only a historical bias, but stems 
from wide-ranging differences in their organization and impact. The asymmetric 
balance between these opposing regulators of protein phosphorylation is also 
common to opposing regulators of two other post-translational modification 
systems, suggesting its fundamental value.

Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a ubiquitous family of molecular 
chaperones that suppress the unspecific aggregation of miscellaneous proteins. 
Multicellular organisms contain a large number of different sHsps, raising 
questions as to whether they function redundantly or are specialized in terms of 
substrates and mechanism. To gain insight into this issue, we undertook a 
comparative analysis of the eight major human sHsps on the aggregation of both 
model proteins and cytosolic lysates under standardized conditions. We 
discovered that sHsps, which form large oligomers (HspB1/Hsp27, HspB3, 
HspB4/αA-crystallin, and HspB5/αB-crystallin) are promiscuous chaperones, 
whereas the chaperone activity of the other sHsps is more substrate-dependent. 
However, all human sHsps analyzed except HspB7 suppressed the aggregation of 
cytosolic proteins of HEK293 cells. We identified ∼1100 heat-sensitive HEK293 
proteins, 12% of which could be isolated in complexes with sHsps. Analysis of 
their biochemical properties revealed that most of the sHsp substrates have a 
molecular mass from 50 to 100 kDa and a slightly acidic pI (5.4-6.8). The 
potency of the sHsps to suppress aggregation of model substrates is correlated 
with their ability to form stable substrate complexes; especially HspB1 and 
HspB5, but also B3, bind tightly to a variety of proteins, whereas fewer 
substrates were detected in complex with the other sHsps, although these were 
also efficient in preventing the aggregation of cytosolic proteins.

Because a cell must adapt to different stresses and growth rates, its 
proteostasis system must too. How do cells detect and adjust proteome folding to 
different conditions? Here, we explore a biophysical cost-benefit principle, 
namely that the cell should keep its proteome as folded as possible at the 
minimum possible energy cost. This can be achieved by differential expression of 
chaperones-balancing foldases (which accelerate folding) against holdases (which 
act as parking spots). The model captures changes in the foldase-holdase ratio 
observed both within organisms during aging and across organisms of varying 
metabolic rates. This work describes a simple biophysical mechanism by which 
cellular proteostasis adapts to meet the needs of a changing growth environment.

Proteins containing DZF (domain associated with zinc fingers) modules play 
important roles throughout gene expression, from transcription to translation. 
Derived from nucleotidyltransferases but lacking catalytic residues, DZF domains 
serve as heterodimerization surfaces between DZF protein pairs. Three DZF 
proteins are widely expressed in mammalian tissues, ILF2, ILF3 and ZFR, which 
form mutually exclusive ILF2-ILF3 and ILF2-ZFR heterodimers. Using eCLIP-Seq, we 
find that ZFR binds across broad intronic regions to regulate the alternative 
splicing of cassette and mutually exclusive exons. ZFR preferentially binds 
dsRNA in vitro and is enriched on introns containing conserved dsRNA elements in 
cells. Many splicing events are similarly altered upon depletion of any of the 
three DZF proteins; however, we also identify independent and opposing roles for 
ZFR and ILF3 in alternative splicing regulation. Along with widespread 
involvement in cassette exon splicing, the DZF proteins control the fidelity and 
regulation of over a dozen highly validated mutually exclusive splicing events. 
Our findings indicate that the DZF proteins form a complex regulatory network 
that leverages dsRNA binding by ILF3 and ZFR to modulate splicing regulation and 
fidelity.

Liquid-liquid phase transitions govern a wide range of protein-protein and 
protein-RNA interactions. Although the importance of multivalency and protein 
disorder in driving these transitions is clear, there is limited knowledge 
concerning the structural basis of phase transitions or the conformational 
changes that accompany this process. In this work, we found that a small human 
protein, SERF2, is important for the formation of stress granules. We determined 
the solution NMR structure ensemble of SERF2. We show that SERF2 specifically 
interacts with non-canonical tetrahelical RNA structures called G-quadruplexes, 
structures linked to stress granule formation. The biophysical amenability of 
both SERF2 and RNA G4 quadruplexes have allowed us to characterize the 
multivalent protein-RNA interactions involved in liquid-liquid phase 
transitions, the role that protein disorder plays in these transitions, identify 
the specific contacts involved, and describe how these interactions impact the 
structural dynamics of the components enabling a detailed understanding of the 
structural transitions involved in early stages of ribonucleoprotein condensate 
formation.

The regulation of metabolic processes by proteins is fundamental to biology and 
yet is incompletely understood. Here we develop a mass spectrometry (MS)-based 
approach that leverages genetic diversity to nominate functional relationships 
between 285 metabolites and 11,868 proteins in living tissues. This method 
recapitulates protein-metabolite functional relationships mediated by direct 
physical interactions and local metabolic pathway regulation while nominating 
3,542 previously undescribed relationships. With this foundation, we identify a 
mechanism of regulation over liver cysteine utilization and cholesterol 
handling, regulated by the poorly characterized protein LRRC58. We show that 
LRRC58 is the substrate adaptor of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates 
proteasomal degradation of CDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme of the catabolic shunt 
of cysteine to taurine1. Cysteine abundance regulates LRRC58-mediated CDO1 
degradation, and depletion of LRRC58 is sufficient to stabilize CDO1 to drive 
consumption of cysteine to produce taurine. Taurine has a central role in 
cholesterol handling, promoting its excretion from the liver2, and we show that 
depletion of LRRC58 in hepatocytes increases cysteine flux to taurine and lowers 
hepatic cholesterol in mice. Uncovering the mechanism of LRRC58 control over 
cysteine catabolism exemplifies the utility of covariation MS to identify modes 
of protein regulation of metabolic processes.

Sciences, Butler University, Indianapolis, IN 46208 USA.

After more than three decades since the discovery of transcription activation 
domains (ADs) in gene-specific activators, the mechanism of their function 
remains enigmatic. The widely accepted model of direct recruitment by ADs of 
co-activators and basal transcriptional machinery components, however, is not 
always compatible with the short size yet very high degree of sequence 
randomness and intrinsic structural disorder of natural and synthetic ADs. In 
this review, we formulate the basis for an alternative and complementary model, 
whereby sequence randomness and intrinsic structural disorder of ADs are 
necessary for transient distorting interactions with promoter nucleosomes, 
triggering promoter nucleosome translocation and subsequently gene activation.

Bovine pulmonary hypertension, brisket disease, causes significant morbidity and 
mortality at elevations above 2,000 m. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) 
is moderately heritable, with inheritance estimated to lie within a few major 
genes. Invasive mPAP measurement is currently the only tool available to 
identify cattle at risk of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. A genetic 
test could allow selection of cattle suitable for high altitude without the need 
for invasive testing. In this study we evaluated three candidate genes (myosin 
heavy chain 15 [MYH15], NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 2, and FK binding 
protein 1A) for association with mPAP in 166 yearling Angus bulls grazing at 
2,182 m. The T allele (rs29016420) of MYH15 was linked to lower mPAP in a 
dominant manner (CC 47.2 ± 1.6 mmHg [mean ± standard error of the mean]; CT/TT 
42.8 ± 0.7 mmHg; P = 0.02). The proportions of cattle with MYH15 CC, CT, and TT 
genotypes were 55%, 41%, and 4%, respectively. Given the high frequency of the 
deleterious allele, it is likely that the relative contribution of MYH15 
polymorphisms to pulmonary hypertension is small, supporting previous 
predictions that the disease is polygenic. We evaluated allelic frequency of 
MYH15 in the Himalayan yak (Bos grunniens), a closely related species adapted to 
high altitude, and found 100% prevalence of T allele homozygosity. In summary, 
we identified a polymorphism in MYH15 significantly associated with mPAP. This 
finding may aid selection of cattle suitable for high altitude and contribute to 
understanding human hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.

In bacteria, translation re-initiation is crucial for synthesizing proteins 
encoded by genes that are organized into operons. The mechanisms regulating 
translation re-initiation remain, however, poorly understood. We now describe 
the ribosome termination structure (RTS), a conserved and stable mRNA secondary 
structure localized immediately downstream of stop codons, and provide 
experimental evidence for its role in governing re-initiation efficiency in a 
synthetic Escherichia coli operon. We further report that RTSs are abundant, 
being associated with 18%-65% of genes in 128 analyzed bacterial genomes 
representing all phyla, and are selectively depleted when translation 
re-initiation is advantageous yet selectively enriched so as to insulate 
translation when re-initiation is deleterious. Our results support a potentially 
universal role for the RTS in controlling translation termination-insulation and 
re-initiation across bacteria.

Proteins interact with one another across a broad spectrum of affinities. Our 
understanding of the low end of this spectrum, as characterized by millimolar 
dissociation constants, relies on a handful of cases in which weak encounters 
have experimentally been identified. These weak interactions away from the 
specific target binding site can lead toward a higher-affinity complex. 
Recently, we detected weak encounters between two paralogous phosphotransferase 
pathways of Escherichia coli, which regulate various metabolic processes and 
stress responses. In addition to encounters that are known to occur between 
cognate proteins, i.e., those that can exchange phosphate groups with each 
other, surprisingly, encounters involving noncognates were also observed. It is 
not clear whether these "futile" encounters have a cooperative or competitive 
role. Using agent-based simulations, we find that the encounter complexes can be 
cooperative or competitive so as to increase or lower the effective binding 
affinity of the specific complex under different circumstances. This finding 
invites further questions into how organisms might exploit such low affinities 
to connect their signaling components.

A synthetic molecule S006-830, belonging to the class of thiophene-containing 
trisubstituted methanes, had shown good in vitro and in vivo bactericidal 
activity against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(Mtb). The molecule had also shown good druglike pharmacokinetic properties. 
However, S006-830 is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, one of which could 
possess a better pharmacological profile than the other. We purified both the 
enantiomers on a chiral column and observed that S-enantiomer has a 
significantly higher inhibitory and cidal activity against Mtb than the 
R-enantiomer. Action of S-S006-830 was "synergistic" for rifampicin and 
"additive" for isoniazid and ethambutol. The combination of S-S006-830 and 
rifampicin produced 100% kill of Mtb within 8 days. In a chemical proteomics 
approach using matrix-bound compound to pull down its target protein(s) from Mtb 
membrane, FabG4 (β-ketoacyl CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.100) emerged as the most 
likely target for S-S006-830. In target validation assays, the compound 
exhibited 2-fold higher inhibitory concentration for an Mtb construct 
overexpressing FabG4. In addition, it inhibited mycolic acid biosynthesis and 
formation of biofilms by Mtb. Molecular docking of S-S006-830 with FabG4 was 
consistent with the experimental data. These results support the development of 
S-S006-830 as a novel lead against tuberculosis.

We present an RNA-Seq based approach to map 3' end sequences of mature 16S rRNA 
(3' TAIL) in bacteria with single-base specificity. Our results show that 3' 
TAILs are heterogeneous among species; they contain the core CCUCC 
anti-Shine-Dalgarno motif, but vary in downstream lengths. Importantly, our 
findings rectify the mis-annotated 16S rRNAs in 11 out of 13 bacterial species 
studied herein (covering Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, and Spirochaetes). Furthermore, our results show 
that species-specific 3' TAIL boundaries are retained due to their high 
complementarity with preferred Shine-Dalgarno sequences, suggesting that 3' TAIL 
bases downstream of the canonical CCUCC motif play a more important role in 
translation initiation than previously reported.

tRNase Z is an essential endonuclease responsible for tRNA 3'-end maturation. 
tRNase Z exists in a short form (tRNase Z(S)) and a long form (tRNase Z(L)). 
Prokaryotes have only tRNase Z(S), whereas eukaryotes can have both forms of 
tRNase Z. Most eukaryotes characterized thus far, including Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and humans, contain 
only one tRNase Z(L) gene encoding both nuclear and mitochondrial forms of 
tRNase Z(L). In contrast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains two essential 
tRNase Z(L) genes (trz1 and trz2) encoding two tRNase Z(L) proteins, which are 
targeted to the nucleus and mitochondria, respectively. Trz1 protein levels are 
notably higher than Trz2 protein levels. Here, using temperature-sensitive 
mutants of trz1 and trz2, we provide in vivo evidence that trz1 and trz2 are 
involved in nuclear and mitochondrial tRNA 3'-end processing, respectively. In 
addition, trz2 is also involved in generation of the 5'-ends of other 
mitochondrial RNAs, whose 5'-ends coincide with the 3'-end of tRNA. Thus, our 
results provide a rare example showing partitioning of the nuclear and 
mitochondrial tRNase Z(L) activities between two different proteins in S. pombe. 
The evolution of two tRNase Z(L) genes and their differential expression in 
fission yeast may avoid toxic off-target effects.

Readthrough Errors Purge Deleterious Cryptic Sequences, Facilitating the Birth 
of Coding Sequences.

De novo protein-coding innovations sometimes emerge from ancestrally noncoding 
DNA, despite the expectation that translating random sequences is overwhelmingly 
likely to be deleterious. The "preadapting selection" hypothesis claims that 
emergence is facilitated by prior, low-level translation of noncoding sequences 
via molecular errors. It predicts that selection on polypeptides translated only 
in error is strong enough to matter and is strongest when erroneous expression 
is high. To test this hypothesis, we examined noncoding sequences located 
downstream of stop codons (i.e., those potentially translated by readthrough 
errors) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. We identified a class of "fragile" 
proteins under strong selection to reduce readthrough, which are unlikely 
substrates for co-option. Among the remainder, sequences showing evidence of 
readthrough translation, as assessed by ribosome profiling, encoded C-terminal 
extensions with higher intrinsic structural disorder, supporting the preadapting 
selection hypothesis. The cryptic sequences beyond the stop codon, rather than 
spillover effects from the regular C-termini, are primarily responsible for the 
higher disorder. Results are robust to controlling for the fact that stronger 
selection also reduces the length of C-terminal extensions. These findings 
indicate that selection acts on 3' UTRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to purge 
potentially deleterious variants of cryptic polypeptides, acting more strongly 
in genes that experience more readthrough errors.

A Gro/TLE-NuRD corepressor complex facilitates Tbx20-dependent transcriptional 
repression.

The cardiac transcription factor Tbx20 has a critical role in the proper 
morphogenetic development of the vertebrate heart, and its misregulation has 
been implicated in human congenital heart disease. Although it is established 
that Tbx20 exerts its function in the embryonic heart through positive and 
negative regulation of distinct gene programs, it is unclear how Tbx20 mediates 
proper transcriptional regulation of its target genes. Here, using a 
combinatorial proteomic and bioinformatic approach, we present the first 
characterization of Tbx20 transcriptional protein complexes. We have 
systematically investigated Tbx20 protein-protein interactions by immunoaffinity 
purification of tagged Tbx20 followed by proteomic analysis using GeLC-MS/MS, 
gene ontology classification, and functional network analysis. We demonstrate 
that Tbx20 is associated with a chromatin remodeling network composed of 
TLE/Groucho corepressors, members of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase 
(NuRD) complex, the chromatin remodeling ATPases RUVBL1/RUVBL2, and the T-box 
repressor Tbx18. We determined that the interaction with TLE corepressors is 
mediated via an eh1 binding motif in Tbx20. Moreover, we demonstrated that 
ablation of this motif results in a failure to properly assemble the repression 
network and disrupts Tbx20 function in vivo. Importantly, we validated Tbx20-TLE 
interactions in the mouse embryonic heart, and identified developmental genes 
regulated by Tbx20-TLE binding, thereby confirming a primary role for a 
Tbx20-TLE repressor complex in embryonic heart development. Together, these 
studies suggest a model in which Tbx20 associates with a Gro/TLE-NuRD repressor 
complex to prevent inappropriate gene activation within the forming heart.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the western 
world. Although optimal medical care and treatment is widely available, the 
prognosis of patients with HF is still poor. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are 
important compartments of the innate immunity. Current studies have identified 
TLRs as critical mediators in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we 
investigated the involvement of TLRs and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors 
(IRFs) in different experimental HF models including viral myocarditis, 
myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we 
investigated for the first time comprehensive TLR and IRF gene and protein 
expression under basal conditions in murine and human cardiac tissue. We found 
that Tlr4, Tlr9 and Irf7 displayed highest gene expression under basal 
conditions, indicating their significant role in first-line defense in the 
murine and human heart. Moreover, induction of TLRs and IRFs clearly differs 
between the various experimental HF models of diverse etiology and the 
concomitant inflammatory status. In the HF model of acute viral-induced 
myocarditis, TLR and IRF activation displayed the uppermost gene expression in 
comparison to the remaining experimental HF models, indicating the highest 
amount of myocardial inflammation in myocarditis. In detail, Irf7 displayed by 
far the highest gene expression during acute viral infection. Interestingly, 
post myocardial infarction TLR and IRF gene expression was almost exclusively 
increased in the infarct zone after myocardial ischemia (Tlr2, Tlr3, Tlr6, Tlr7, 
Tlr9, Irf3, Irf7). With one exception, Irf3 showed a decreased gene expression 
in the remote zone post infarction. Finally, we identified Irf7 as novel 
cardiovascular stress-inducible factor in the pathologically stressed heart. 
These findings on TLR and IRF function in the inflamed heart highlight the 
complexity of inflammatory immune response and raise more interesting questions 
for future investigation.

How heterogeneous are proteome folding timescales and what physical principles, 
if any, dictate its limits? We answer this by predicting copy number weighted 
folding speed distribution - using the native topology - for E.coli and Yeast 
proteome. E.coli and Yeast proteomes yield very similar distributions with 
average folding times of 100 milliseconds and 170 milliseconds, respectively. 
The topology-based folding time distribution is well described by a 
diffusion-drift mutation model on a flat-fitness landscape in free energy 
barrier between two boundaries: i) the lowest barrier height determined by the 
upper limit of folding speed and ii) the highest barrier height governed by the 
lower speed limit of folding. While the fastest time scale of the distribution 
is near the experimentally measured speed limit of 1 microsecond (typical of 
barrier-less folders), we find the slowest folding time to be around seconds 
([Formula: see text]8 seconds for Yeast distribution), approximately an order of 
magnitude less than the fastest halflife (approximately 2 minutes) in the Yeast 
proteome. This separation of timescale implies even the fastest degrading 
protein will have moderately high (96%) probability of folding before 
degradation. The overall agreement with the flat-fitness landscape model further 
hints that proteome folding times did not undergo additional major selection 
pressures - to make proteins fold faster - other than the primary requirement to 
"sufficiently beat the clock" against its lifetime. Direct comparison between 
the predicted folding time and experimentally measured halflife further shows 
99% of the proteome have a folding time less than their corresponding lifetime. 
These two findings together suggest that proteome folding kinetics may be 
bounded by protein halflife.

So far there has been no comprehensive review using systematic literature search 
strategies to show the application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in 
the human testis of the whole life cycle (from embryos to aging males). Here, we 
summarized the application of scRNA-seq analyses on various human testicular 
biological samples. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO), focusing on English researches published after 2009. 
Articles related to GEO data-series were also retrieved in PubMed or BioRxiv. 81 
full-length studies were finally included in the review. ScRNA-seq has been 
widely used on different human testicular samples with various library 
strategies, and new cell subtypes such as State 0 spermatogonial stem cells 
(SSC) and stage_a/b/c Sertoli cells (SC) were identified. For the development of 
normal testes, scRNA-seq-based evidence showed dynamic transcriptional changes 
of both germ cells and somatic cells from embryos to adults. And dysregulated 
metabolic signaling or hedgehog signaling were revealed by scRNA-seq in aged SC 
or Leydig cells (LC), respectively. For infertile males, scRNA-seq studies 
revealed profound changes of testes, such as the increased proportion of 
immature SC/LC of Klinefelter syndrome, the somatic immaturity and altered 
germline autophagy of patients with non-obstructive azoospermia, and the 
repressed differentiation of SSC in trans-females receiving testosterone 
inhibition therapy. Besides, the re-analyzing of public scRNA-seq data made 
further discoveries such as the potential vulnerability of testicular SARS-CoV-2 
infection, and both evolutionary conservatism and divergence among species. 
ScRNA-seq analyses would unveil mechanisms of testes' development and changes so 
as to help developing novel treatments for male infertility.

The self-assembly of alternative conformations of normal proteins into amyloid 
aggregates has been implicated in both the acquisition of new functions and in 
the appearance and progression of disease. However, while these amyloidogenic 
pathways are linked to the emergence of new phenotypes, numerous studies have 
uncoupled the accumulation of aggregates from their biological consequences, 
revealing currently underappreciated complexity in the determination of these 
traits. Here, to explore the molecular basis of protein-only phenotypes, we 
focused on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup35/[PSI(+)] prion, which confers a 
translation termination defect and expression level-dependent toxicity in its 
amyloid form. Our studies reveal that aggregated Sup35 retains its normal 
function as a translation release factor. However, fluctuations in the 
composition and size of these complexes specifically alter the level of this 
aggregate-associated activity and thereby the severity and toxicity of the 
amyloid state. Thus, amyloid heterogeneity is a crucial contributor to 
protein-only phenotypes.

A novel open tubular nanoproteomic platform featuring accelerated on-line 
protein digestion and high-resolution nano liquid chromatography mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) has been developed. The platform features very narrow open 
tubular columns, and is hence particularly suited for limited sample amounts. 
For enzymatic digestion of proteins, samples are passed through a 20 µm inner 
diameter (ID) trypsin + endoproteinase Lys-C immobilized open tubular enzyme 
reactor (OTER). Resulting peptides are subsequently trapped on a monolithic 
pre-column and transferred on-line to a 10 µm ID porous layer open tubular 
(PLOT) liquid chromatography LC separation column. Wnt/ß-catenein signaling 
pathway (Wnt-pathway) proteins of potentially diagnostic value were 
digested+detected in targeted-MS/MS mode in small cell samples and tumor tissues 
within 120 minutes. For example, a potential biomarker Axin1 was identifiable in 
just 10 ng of sample (protein extract of ∼1,000 HCT15 colon cancer cells). In 
comprehensive mode, the current OTER-PLOT set-up could be used to identify 
approximately 1500 proteins in HCT15 cells using a relatively short 
digestion+detection cycle (240 minutes), outperforming previously reported 
on-line digestion/separation systems. The platform is fully automated utilizing 
common commercial instrumentation and parts, while the reactor and columns are 
simple to produce and have low carry-over. These initial results point to 
automated solutions for fast and very sensitive MS based proteomics, especially 
for samples of limited size.

TRPM7 is an essential and ubiquitous channel-kinase regulating cellular influx 
of Mg2+. Although TRPM7 mRNA is highly abundant, very small amount of the 
protein is detected in cells, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of 
trpm7 gene expression. We found that TRPM7 mRNA 5'-leader contains two 
evolutionarily conserved upstream open reading frames that act together to 
drastically inhibit translation of the TRPM7 reading frame at high magnesium 
levels and ensure its optimal translation at low magnesium levels, when the 
activity of the channel-kinase is most required. The study provides the first 
example of magnesium channel synthesis being controlled by Mg2+ in higher 
eukaryotes.

Proteins in the crowded environment of human cells have often been studied 
regarding nonspecific interactions, misfolding, and aggregation, which may cause 
cellular malfunction and disease. Specifically, proteins with high abundance are 
more susceptible to these issues due to the law of mass action. Therefore, the 
surfaces of highly abundant cytoplasmic (HAC) proteins directly exposed to the 
environment can exhibit specific physicochemical, structural, and geometrical 
characteristics that reduce nonspecific interactions and adapt to the 
environment. However, the quantitative relationships between the overall surface 
descriptors still need clarification. Here, we used machine learning to identify 
HAC proteins using hydrophobicity, charge, roughness, secondary structures, and 
B-factor from the protein surfaces and quantified the contribution of each 
descriptor. First, several supervised learning algorithms were compared to solve 
binary classification problems for the surfaces of HAC and extracellular 
proteins. Then, logistic regression was used for the feature importance analysis 
of descriptors considering model performance (80.2% accuracy and 87.6% AUC) and 
interpretability. The HAC proteins showed positive correlations with negatively 
and positively charged areas but negative correlations with hydrophobicity, the 
B-factor, the proportion of beta structures, roughness, and the proportion of 
disordered regions. Finally, the details of each descriptor could be explained 
concerning adaptative surface strategies of HAC proteins to regulate nonspecific 
interactions, protein folding, flexibility, stability, and adsorption. This 
study presented a novel approach using various surface descriptors to identify 
HAC proteins and provided quantitative design rules for the surfaces well-suited 
to human cellular crowded environments.

Steroid-resistance is a common complication in the treatment of malignancies and 
autoimmune diseases. IL-7/IL-7R signaling, which regulates lymphocyte growth and 
survival, has been implicated in the development of malignancies and autoimmune 
diseases. However, the biological significance of IL-7/IL-7R signaling in 
steroid treatment is poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel relationship 
between IL-7R signaling and steroid-resistance, and showed that an anti-IL-7R 
antibody conjugated with SN-38 (A7R-ADC-SN-38) has strong anti-tumor effects 
against both parental and steroid-resistant malignant cells. Furthermore, 
inflammation in the mouse autoimmune arthritis model was suppressed to greater 
extent by A7R-ADC conjugated to MMAE than by A7R-ADC-SN-38. Given that an 
increased proportion of IL-7R-positive cells is a common mechanism underlying 
the pathogenesis of autoimmunity, we found that specific depletion of this cell 
population abrogated the progression of disease. This suggests that the 
cytotoxicity and immunosuppressive capacity of A7R-ADC could be modulated to 
treat specific malignancies or autoimmune diseases through the introduction of 
different payloads, and represents a novel alternative to steroid therapy.

Sensitivity of cancer cells to DNA damaging chemotherapeutics is determined by 
DNA repair processes. Consequently, cancer cells may upregulate the expression 
of certain DNA repair genes as a mechanism to promote chemoresistance. Here, we 
report that RECQ1, a breast cancer susceptibility gene that encodes the most 
abundant RecQ helicase in humans, is a p53-regulated gene, potentially acting as 
a defense against DNA damaging agents. We show that RECQ1 mRNA and protein 
levels are upregulated upon treatment of cancer cells with a variety of DNA 
damaging agents including the DNA-alkylating agent methylmethanesulfonate (MMS). 
The MMS-induced upregulation of RECQ1 expression is p53-dependent as it was 
observed in p53-proficient but not in isogenic p53-deficient cells. The RECQ1 
promoter is bound by endogenous p53 and is responsive to p53 in luciferase 
reporter assays suggesting that RECQ1 is a direct target of p53. Treatment with 
the chemotherapeutic drugs temozolomide and fotemustine also increased RECQ1 
mRNA levels whereas depletion of RECQ1 enhanced cellular sensitivity to these 
agents. These results identify a previously unrecognized p53-mediated 
upregulation of RECQ1 expression in response to DNA damage and implicate RECQ1 
in the repair of DNA lesions including those induced by alkylating and other 
chemotherapeutic agents.

MabR (Rv2242), a PucR-type transcription factor, plays a crucial role in 
regulating mycolic acid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To 
understand its regulatory mechanisms, we determined the crystal structures of 
its N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain adopts a 
globin-like fold, while the C-terminal domain comprises an α/β GGDEF domain and 
an all-α effector domain with a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. This unique 
domain combination is specific to Actinomycetes. Biochemical and computational 
studies suggest that full-length MabR forms both dimeric and tetrameric 
assemblies in solution. Structural analysis revealed two distinct dimerization 
interfaces within the N- and C-terminal domains, further supporting a tetrameric 
organization. These findings provide valuable insights into the domain 
architecture, oligomeric state, and potential regulatory mechanisms of MabR.

The 20 protein-coding amino acids are found in proteomes with different relative 
abundances. The most abundant amino acid, leucine, is nearly an order of 
magnitude more prevalent than the least abundant amino acid, cysteine. Amino 
acid metabolic costs differ similarly, constraining their incorporation into 
proteins. On the other hand, a diverse set of protein sequences is necessary to 
build functional proteomes. Here, we present a simple model for a cost-diversity 
trade-off postulating that natural proteomes minimize amino acid metabolic flux 
while maximizing sequence entropy. The model explains the relative abundances of 
amino acids across a diverse set of proteomes. We found that the data are 
remarkably well explained when the cost function accounts for amino acid 
chemical decay. More than 100 organisms reach comparable solutions to the 
trade-off by different combinations of proteome cost and sequence diversity. 
Quantifying the interplay between proteome size and entropy shows that proteomes 
can get optimally large and diverse.

The process of drug discovery and development is both lengthy and intricate, 
demanding a substantial investment of time and financial resources. 
Bioinformatics techniques and tools can not only accelerate the identification 
of drug targets and the screening and refinement of drug candidates, but also 
facilitate the characterization of side effects and the prediction of drug 
resistance. High-throughput data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics make significant contributions to mechanics-based drug discovery 
and drug reuse. This paper summarizes bioinformatics technologies and tools in 
drug research and development and their roles and applications in drug research 
and development, aiming to provide references for the development of new drugs 
and the realization of precision medicine.

The yeast enzyme Eht1 is an octanoyl-CoA:ethanol acyltransferase that also 
functions as a thioesterase.

Fatty acid ethyl esters are secondary metabolites that are produced during 
microbial fermentation, in fruiting plants and in higher organisms during 
ethanol stress. In particular, volatile medium-chain fatty acid ethyl esters are 
important flavour compounds that impart desirable fruit aromas to fermented 
beverages, including beer and wine. The biochemical synthesis of medium-chain 
fatty acid ethyl esters is poorly understood but likely involves 
acyl-CoA:ethanol O-acyltransferases. Here, we characterize the enzyme ethanol 
hexanoyl transferase 1 (Eht1) from the brewer's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
Full-length Eht1 was successfully overexpressed from a recombinant yeast plasmid 
and purified at the milligram scale after detergent solubilization of 
sedimenting membranes. Recombinant Eht1 was functional as an acyltransferase 
and, unexpectedly, was optimally active toward octanoyl-CoA, with k(cat)  = 0.28 
± 0.02/s and K(M)  = 1.9 ± 0.6 μm. Eht1 was also revealed to be active as a 
thioesterase but was not able to hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl acyl esters, in 
contrast to the findings of a previous study. Low-resolution structural data and 
site-directed mutagenesis provide experimental support for a predicted 
α/β-hydrolase domain featuring a Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad. The S. cerevisiae 
gene YBR177C/EHT1 should thus be reannotated as coding for an 
octanoyl-CoA:ethanol acyltransferase that can also function as a thioesterase.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous degenerative motor neuron 
disease linked to numerous genetic mutations in apparently unrelated proteins. 
These proteins, including SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS, are highly aggregation-prone 
and form a variety of intracellular inclusion bodies that are characteristic of 
different neuropathological subtypes of the disease. Contained within these 
inclusions are a variety of proteins that do not share obvious characteristics 
other than coaggregation. However, recent evidence from other neurodegenerative 
disorders suggests that disease-affected biochemical pathways can be 
characterized by the presence of proteins that are supersaturated, with cellular 
concentrations significantly greater than their solubilities. Here, we show that 
the proteins that form inclusions of mutant SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS are not merely 
a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are 
themselves supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in 
inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average 
supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native 
interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an 
average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in 
various forms of ALS result from a set of proteins that are metastable in motor 
neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive 
collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

Sec17 [soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein; 
α-SNAP] and Sec18 (NSF) perform ATP-dependent disassembly of cis-SNARE 
complexes, liberating SNAREs for subsequent assembly of trans-complexes for 
fusion. A mutant of Sec17, with limited ability to stimulate Sec18, still 
strongly enhanced fusion when ample Sec18 was supplied, suggesting that Sec17 
has additional functions. We used fusion reactions where the four SNAREs were 
initially separate, thus requiring no disassembly by Sec18. With proteoliposomes 
bearing asymmetrically disposed SNAREs, tethering and trans-SNARE pairing 
allowed slow fusion. Addition of Sec17 did not affect the levels of trans-SNARE 
complex but triggered sudden fusion of trans-SNARE paired proteoliposomes. Sec18 
did not substitute for Sec17 in triggering fusion, but ADP- or ATPγS-bound Sec18 
enhanced this Sec17 function. The extent of the Sec17 effect varied with the 
lipid headgroup and fatty acyl composition of the proteoliposomes. Two mutants 
further distinguished the two Sec17 functions: Sec17(L291A,L292A) did not 
stimulate Sec18 to disassemble cis-SNARE complex but triggered the fusion of 
trans-SNARE paired membranes. Sec17(F21S,M22S), with diminished apolar character 
to its hydrophobic loop, fully supported Sec18-mediated SNARE complex 
disassembly but had lost the capacity to stimulate the fusion of trans-SNARE 
paired membranes. To model the interactions of SNARE-bound Sec17 with membranes, 
we show that Sec17, but not Sec17(F21S,M22S), interacted synergistically with 
the soluble SNARE domains to enable their stable association with liposomes. We 
propose a model in which Sec17 binds to trans-SNARE complexes, oligomerizes, and 
inserts apolar loops into the apposed membranes, locally disturbing the lipid 
bilayer and thereby lowering the energy barrier for fusion.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders affecting the heart and 
blood vessels and a leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, there is a need to 
identify new cardiokines that may protect the heart from damage as reported in 
GBD 2017 Causes of Death Collaborators (2018) (The Lancet 392:1736-1788). 
Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is a cardiokine that is highly expressed in the heart 
and released to the serum after cardiac injury where it is associated with CVD 
and predicts poor outcome. The action of FSTL1 likely depends not only on the 
tissue source but also post-translation modifications that are target tissue- 
and cell-specific. Animal studies examining the effect of FSTL1 in various 
models of heart disease have exploded over the past 15 years and primarily 
report a protective effect spanning from inhibiting inflammation via 
transforming growth factor, preventing remodeling and fibrosis to promoting 
angiogenesis and hypertrophy. A better understanding of FSTL1 and its homologs 
is needed to determine whether this protein could be a useful novel biomarker to 
predict poor outcome and death and whether it has therapeutic potential. The aim 
of this review is to provide a comprehensive description of the literature for 
this family of proteins in order to better understand their role in normal 
physiology and CVD.

Biomarker discovery is essential for the understanding, diagnosis, targeted 
therapy and prognosis assessment of malignant diseases. However, it remains a 
huge challenge due to the lack of sensitive methods to identify disease-specific 
rare molecules. Here we present MORAC, molecular recognition based on affinity 
and catalysis, which enables the effective identification of candidate 
biomarkers with low abundance. MORAC relies on a class of DNAzymes, each 
cleaving a sole RNA linkage embedded in their DNA chain upon specifically 
sensing a complex system with no prior knowledge of the system's molecular 
content. We show that signal amplification from catalysis ensures the DNAzymes 
high sensitivity (for target probing); meanwhile, a simple RNA-to-DNA mutation 
can shut down their RNA cleavage ability and turn them into a pure affinity tool 
(for target pulldown). Using MORAC, we identify previously unknown, 
low-abundance candidate biomarkers with clear clinical value, including 
apolipoprotein L6 in breast cancer and seryl-tRNA synthetase 1 in polyps 
preceding colon cancer.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is the guanine nucleotide 
exchange factor of the GTPase eIF2, which brings the initiator Met-tRNAi to the 
ribosome in the form of the eIF2-GTP·Met-tRNAi ternary complex (TC). The 
activity of eIF2B is inhibited by phosphorylation of its substrate eIF2 by 
several stress-induced kinases, which triggers the integrated stress response 
(ISR). The ISR plays a central role in maintaining homeostasis in the cell under 
various stress conditions, and its dysregulation is a causative factor in the 
pathology of a number of neurodegenerative disorders. Over the past three 
decades, virtually every aspect of eIF2B function has been the subject of 
uncertainty or controversy: from the catalytic mechanism of nucleotide exchange, 
to whether eIF2B only catalyzes nucleotide exchange on eIF2 or also promotes 
binding of Met-tRNAi to eIF2-GTP to form the TC. Here, we provide the first 
complete thermodynamic analysis of the process of recycling of eIF2-GDP to the 
TC. The available evidence leads to the conclusion that eIF2 is channeled from 
the ribosome (as an eIF5·eIF2-GDP complex) to eIF2B, converted by eIF2B to the 
TC, which is then channeled back to eIF5 and the ribosome. The system has 
evolved to be regulated by multiple factors, including post-translational 
modifications of eIF2, eIF2B, and eIF5, as well as directly by the energy 
balance in the cell, through the GTP:GDP ratio.

The presence of protein deposits is a common pathological hallmark in patients 
suffering from neurodegenerative conditions and other proteinopathies. 
Deciphering the molecular basis of protein misfolding and aggregation is a 
crucial step towards the full comprehension of the factors that trigger the 
onset of these diseases and for the development of efficient therapeutical 
strategies. In this regard, in vitro aggregation assays for misfolded proteins 
offer an excellent tool to study pathological processes of protein deposition 
under controlled conditions, where confounders can be easily discriminated. 
These methods are generally cost-effective and have been proved useful in many 
fields, including drug discovery and clinical diagnostics. Here, we review the 
bases of in vitro aggregation and seeding assays, recapitulate their main 
applications and offer a critical evaluation of their limitations. Comprehending 
the molecular mechanisms behind these assays and combining them with in vivo or 
cell-based experiments will maximize their potential and allow the necessary 
improvement to overcome some of the current drawbacks.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurological disorder caused 
by CAG-repeat expansion in exon 1 of Huntingtin (HTT). But in addition to the 
neurological disease, mutant HTT (mHTT), which is ubiquitously expressed, 
impairs other organ systems. Indeed, epidemiological and animal model studies 
suggest higher incidence of and mortality from heart disease in HD. Here, we 
show that the protein complex mTORC1 is dysregulated in two HD mouse models 
through a mechanism that requires intrinsic mHTT expression. Moreover, restoring 
cardiac mTORC1 activity with constitutively active Rheb prevents mortality and 
relieves the mHTT-induced block to hypertrophic adaptation to cardiac stress. 
Finally, we show that chronic mTORC1 dysregulation is due in part to 
mislocalization of endogenous Rheb. These data provide insight into the 
increased cardiac-related mortality of HD patients, with cardiac mHTT expression 
inhibiting mTORC1 activity, limiting heart growth, and decreasing the heart's 
ability to compensate to chronic stress.

The exchange of signals between cellular compartments coordinates development 
and differentiation, modulates metabolic pathways, and triggers responses to 
environmental conditions. The proposed central regulator of plastid-to-nucleus 
retrograde signaling, GENOMES UNCOUPLED1 (GUN1), is present at very low levels, 
which has hampered the discovery of its precise molecular function. Here, we 
show that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) GUN1 protein accumulates to 
detectable levels only at very early stages of leaf development, where it 
functions in the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis. GUN1 mRNA is present at 
high levels in all tissues, but GUN1 protein undergoes rapid degradation (with 
an estimated half-life of ∼4 h) in all tissues where chloroplast biogenesis has 
been completed. The rapid turnover of GUN1 is controlled mainly by the chaperone 
ClpC1, suggesting degradation of GUN1 by the Clp protease. Degradation of GUN1 
slows under stress conditions that alter retrograde signaling, thus ensuring 
that the plant has sufficient GUN1 protein. We also find that the 
pentatricopeptide repeat motifs of GUN1 are important determinants of GUN1 
stability. Moreover, overexpression of GUN1 causes an early flowering phenotype, 
suggesting a function of GUN1 in developmental phase transitions beyond 
chloroplast biogenesis. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the 
regulation of GUN1 by proteolytic degradation, uncover its function in early 
chloroplast biogenesis, and suggest a role in developmental phase transitions.

Activation of G Proteins by Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors Relies on GTPase 
Activity.

G proteins are an important family of signalling molecules controlled by guanine 
nucleotide exchange and GTPase activity in what is commonly called an 
'activation/inactivation cycle'. The molecular mechanism by which guanine 
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyse the activation of monomeric G 
proteins is well-established, however the complete reversibility of this 
mechanism is often overlooked. Here, we use a theoretical approach to prove that 
GEFs are unable to positively control G protein systems at steady-state in the 
absence of GTPase activity. Instead, positive regulation of G proteins must be 
seen as a product of the competition between guanine nucleotide exchange and 
GTPase activity--emphasising a central role for GTPase activity beyond merely 
signal termination. We conclude that a more accurate description of the 
regulation of G proteins via these processes is as a 'balance/imbalance' 
mechanism. This result has implications for the understanding of intracellular 
signalling processes, and for experimental strategies that rely on modulating G 
protein systems.

The antimetabolite pentyl pantothenamide has broad spectrum antibiotic activity 
but exhibits enhanced activity against Escherichia coli. The PanDZ complex has 
been proposed to regulate the pantothenate biosynthetic pathway in E. coli by 
limiting the supply of β-alanine in response to coenzyme A concentration. We 
show that formation of such a complex between activated aspartate decarboxylase 
(PanD) and PanZ leads to sequestration of the pyruvoyl cofactor as a ketone 
hydrate and demonstrate that both PanZ overexpression-linked β-alanine 
auxotrophy and pentyl pantothenamide toxicity are due to formation of this 
complex. This both demonstrates that the PanDZ complex regulates pantothenate 
biosynthesis in a cellular context and validates the complex as a target for 
antibiotic development.

Compared to other data-intensive disciplines such as genomics, public deposition 
and storage of MS-based proteomics, data are still less developed due to, among 
other reasons, the inherent complexity of the data and the variety of data types 
and experimental workflows. In order to address this need, several public 
repositories for MS proteomics experiments have been developed, each with 
different purposes in mind. The most established resources are the Global 
Proteome Machine Database (GPMDB), PeptideAtlas, and the PRIDE database. 
Additionally, there are other useful (in many cases recently developed) 
resources such as ProteomicsDB, Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual 
Environment (MassIVE), Chorus, MaxQB, PeptideAtlas SRM Experiment Library 
(PASSEL), Model Organism Protein Expression Database (MOPED), and the Human 
Proteinpedia. In addition, the ProteomeXchange consortium has been recently 
developed to enable better integration of public repositories and the 
coordinated sharing of proteomics information, maximizing its benefit to the 
scientific community. Here, we will review each of the major proteomics 
resources independently and some tools that enable the integration, mining and 
reuse of the data. We will also discuss some of the major challenges and current 
pitfalls in the integration and sharing of the data.

The co-operation of specialized organ systems in complex multicellular organisms 
depends on effective chemical communication. Thus, body fluids (like blood, 
lymph or intraspinal fluid) contain myriads of signaling mediators apart from 
metabolites. Moreover, these fluids are also of crucial importance for immune 
and wound responses. Compositional analyses of human body fluids are therefore 
of paramount diagnostic importance. Further improving their comprehensiveness 
should increase our understanding of inter-organ communication. In arthropods, 
which have trachea for gas exchange and an open circulatory system, the single 
dominating interstitial fluid is the hemolymph. Accordingly, a detailed analysis 
of hemolymph composition should provide an especially comprehensive picture of 
chemical communication and defense in animals. Therefore we used an extensive 
protein fractionation workflow in combination with a discovery-driven proteomic 
approach to map out the detectable protein composition of hemolymph isolated 
from Drosophila larvae. Combined mass spectrometric analysis revealed more than 
700 proteins extending far beyond the previously known Drosophila hemolymph 
proteome. Moreover, by comparing hemolymph isolated from either fed or starved 
larvae, we provide initial provisional insights concerning compositional changes 
in response to nutritional state. Storage proteins in particular were observed 
to be strongly reduced by starvation. Our hemolymph proteome catalog provides a 
rich basis for data mining, as exemplified by our identification of potential 
novel cytokines, as well as for future quantitative analyses by targeted 
proteomics.

We characterize in real time the composition and catalytic state of the initial 
Escherichia coli transcription-coupled repair (TCR) machinery by using 
correlative single-molecule methods. TCR initiates when RNA polymerase (RNAP) 
stalled by a lesion is displaced by the Mfd DNA translocase, thus giving repair 
components access to the damage. We previously used DNA nanomanipulation to 
obtain a nanomechanical readout of protein-DNA interactions during TCR 
initiation. Here we correlate this signal with simultaneous single-molecule 
fluorescence imaging of labeled components (RNAP, Mfd or RNA) to monitor the 
composition and localization of the complex. Displacement of stalled RNAP by Mfd 
results in loss of nascent RNA but not of RNAP, which remains associated with 
Mfd as a long-lived complex on the DNA. This complex translocates at ∼4 bp/s 
along the DNA, in a manner determined by the orientation of the stalled RNAP on 
the DNA.

Molecular chaperones play an important role in protein homeostasis and the 
cellular response to stress. In particular, the HSP70 chaperones in yeast 
mediate a large volume of protein folding through transient associations with 
their substrates. This chaperone interaction network can be disturbed by various 
perturbations, such as environmental stress or a gene deletion. Here, we 
consider deletions of two major chaperone proteins, SSA1 and SSB1, from the 
chaperone network in Sacchromyces cerevisiae. We employ a SILAC-based approach 
to examine changes in global and local protein abundance and rationalise our 
results via network analysis and graph theoretical approaches. Although the 
deletions result in an overall increase in intracellular protein content, 
correlated with an increase in cell size, this is not matched by substantial 
changes in individual protein concentrations. Despite the phenotypic robustness 
to deletion of these major hub proteins, it cannot be simply explained by the 
presence of paralogues. Instead, network analysis and a theoretical 
consideration of folding workload suggest that the robustness to perturbation is 
a product of the overall network structure. This highlights how quantitative 
proteomics and systems modelling can be used to rationalise emergent network 
properties, and how the HSP70 system can accommodate the loss of major hubs.

Amyloidogenic protein aggregation impairs cell function and is a hallmark of 
many chronic degenerative disorders. Protein aggregation is also a major event 
during acute injury; however, unlike amyloidogenesis, the process of 
injury-induced protein aggregation remains largely undefined. To provide this 
insight, we profiled the insoluble proteome of several cell types after acute 
injury. These experiments show that the disulfide-driven process of 
nucleocytoplasmic coagulation (NCC) is the main form of injury-induced protein 
aggregation. NCC is mechanistically distinct from amyloidogenesis, but still 
broadly impairs cell function by promoting the aggregation of hundreds of 
abundant and essential intracellular proteins. A small proportion of the 
intracellular proteome resists NCC and is instead released from necrotic cells. 
Notably, the physicochemical properties of NCC-resistant proteins are contrary 
to those of NCC-sensitive proteins. These observations challenge the dogma that 
liberation of constituents during necrosis is anarchic. Rather, inherent 
physicochemical features including cysteine content, hydrophobicity and 
intrinsic disorder determine whether a protein is released from necrotic cells. 
Furthermore, as half of the identified NCC-resistant proteins are known 
autoantigens, we propose that physicochemical properties that control NCC also 
affect immune tolerance and other host responses important for the restoration 
of homeostasis after necrotic injury.

Macrophages play a key role in tissue regeneration by polarizing to different 
destinies and generating various phenotypes. Recognizing the underlying 
mechanisms is critical in designing therapeutic procedures targeting macrophage 
fate determination. Here, to investigate the macrophage polarization, a 
nonlinear mathematical model is proposed in which the effect of IL4, IFNγ and 
LPS, as external stimuli, on STAT1, STAT6, and NFκB is studied using bifurcation 
analysis. The existence of saddle-node bifurcations in these internal key 
regulators allows different combinations of steady state levels which are 
attributable to different fates. Therefore, we propose dynamic bifurcation as a 
crucial built-in mechanism of macrophage polarization. Next, in order to 
investigate the polarization of a population of macrophages, bifurcation 
analysis is employed aligned with agent-based approach and a two-layer model is 
proposed in which the information from single cells is exploited to model the 
behavior in tissue level. Also, in this model, a partial differential equation 
describes the diffusion of secreted cytokines in the medium. Finally, the model 
was validated against a set of experimental data. Taken together, we have here 
developed a cell and tissue level model of macrophage polarization behavior 
which can be used for designing therapeutic interventions.

During the course of evolution, organisms have developed genetic mechanisms in 
response to various environmental stresses including wounding from mechanical 
damage or herbivory-caused injury. A previous study of wounding response in the 
plant tobacco identified a unique wound-induced gene, aptly named KED due to its 
coding for a protein that has an unusually high content of amino acids lysine 
(K), glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D). However, by far little is known 
about this intriguing gene. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary 
aspects of the KED-rich coding genes. We found that a consistent pattern of 
wound-induced KED gene expression is maintained across representative species of 
angiosperm and gymnosperm. KED genes can be identified in species from all 
groups of land plants (Embryophyta). All the KED proteins from vascular plants 
(Tracheophyta) including angiosperm, gymnosperm, fern and lycophyte share a 
conserved 19-amino acid domain near the C-terminus, whereas bryophytes (moss, 
liverwort and hornwort) possess KED-rich, multi-direct-repeat sequences that are 
distinct from the vascular plant KEDs. We detected KED-rich sequences in 
Charophyta species but not in Chlorophyta wherever genome sequences are 
available. Our studies suggest diverse and complex evolution pathways for land 
plant KED genes. Vascular plant KEDs exhibit high evolutionary conservation, 
implicating their shared function in response to wounding stress. The 
extraordinary enrichment of amino acids K, E and D in these groups of distinct 
and widely distributed proteins may reflect the structural and functional 
requirement for these three residues during some 600 million years of land plant 
evolution.

One challenge in cell biology is to decipher the biophysical mechanisms 
governing protein enrichment on curved membranes and the resulting membrane 
deformation. The ERM protein ezrin is abundant and associated with cellular 
membranes that are flat, positively or negatively curved. Using in vitro and 
cell biology approaches, we assess mechanisms of ezrin's enrichment on curved 
membranes. We evidence that wild-type ezrin (ezrinWT) and its phosphomimetic 
mutant T567D (ezrinTD) do not deform membranes but self-assemble 
anti-parallelly, zipping adjacent membranes. EzrinTD's specific conformation 
reduces intermolecular interactions, allows binding to actin filaments, which 
reduces membrane tethering, and promotes ezrin binding to positively-curved 
membranes. While neither ezrinTD nor ezrinWT senses negative curvature alone, we 
demonstrate that interacting with curvature-sensing I-BAR-domain proteins 
facilitates ezrin enrichment in negatively-curved membrane protrusions. Overall, 
our work demonstrates that ezrin can tether membranes, or be targeted to curved 
membranes, depending on conformations and interactions with actin and 
curvature-sensing binding partners.

Although it is well appreciated that gene expression is inherently noisy and 
that transcriptional noise is encoded in a promoter's sequence, little is known 
about the extent to which noise levels of individual promoters vary across 
growth conditions. Using flow cytometry, we here quantify transcriptional noise 
in Escherichia coli genome-wide across 8 growth conditions and find that noise 
levels systematically decrease with growth rate, with a condition-dependent 
lower bound on noise. Whereas constitutive promoters consistently exhibit low 
noise in all conditions, regulated promoters are both more noisy on average and 
more variable in noise across conditions. Moreover, individual promoters show 
highly distinct variation in noise across conditions. We show that a simple 
model of noise propagation from regulators to their targets can explain a 
significant fraction of the variation in relative noise levels and identifies 
TFs that most contribute to both condition-specific and condition-independent 
noise propagation. In addition, analysis of the genome-wide correlation 
structure of various gene properties shows that gene regulation, expression 
noise, and noise plasticity are all positively correlated genome-wide and vary 
independently of variations in absolute expression, codon bias, and evolutionary 
rate. Together, our results show that while absolute expression noise tends to 
decrease with growth rate, relative noise levels of genes are highly 
condition-dependent and determined by the propagation of noise through the gene 
regulatory network.

Unbiased and sensitive quantification of low abundance small proteins in human 
plasma (e.g. hormones, immune factors, metabolic regulators) remains an unmet 
need. These small protein factors are typically analyzed individually and using 
antibodies that can lack specificity. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics 
has the potential to address these problems, however the analysis of plasma by 
MS is plagued by the extremely large dynamic range of this body fluid, with 
protein abundances spanning at least 13 orders of magnitude. Here we describe an 
enrichment assay (SPEA), that greatly simplifies the plasma dynamic range 
problem by enriching small-proteins of 2-10 kDa, enabling the rapid, specific 
and sensitive quantification of >100 small-protein factors in a single 
untargeted LC-MS/MS acquisition. Applying this method to perform deep-proteome 
profiling of human plasma we identify C5ORF46 as a previously uncharacterized 
human plasma protein. We further demonstrate the reproducibility of our workflow 
for low abundance protein analysis using a stable-isotope labeled protein 
standard of insulin spiked into human plasma. SPEA provides the ability to study 
numerous important hormones in a single rapid assay, which we applied to study 
the intermittent fasting response and observed several unexpected changes 
including decreased plasma abundance of the iron homeostasis regulator hepcidin.

Previous evidence indicates that a number of proteins are able to interact with 
cognate mRNAs. These autogenous associations represent important regulatory 
mechanisms that control gene expression at the translational level. Using the 
catRAPID approach to predict the propensity of proteins to bind to RNA, we 
investigated the occurrence of autogenous associations in the human proteome. 
Our algorithm correctly identified binding sites in well-known cases such as 
thymidylate synthase, tumor suppressor P53, synaptotagmin-1, 
serine/ariginine-rich splicing factor 2, heat shock 70 kDa, ribonucleic 
particle-specific U1A and ribosomal protein S13. In addition, we found that 
several other proteins are able to bind to their own mRNAs. A large-scale 
analysis of biological pathways revealed that aggregation-prone and structurally 
disordered proteins have the highest propensity to interact with cognate RNAs. 
These findings are substantiated by experimental evidence on amyloidogenic 
proteins such as TAR DNA-binding protein 43 and fragile X mental retardation 
protein. Among the amyloidogenic proteins, we predicted that Parkinson's 
disease-related α-synuclein is highly prone to interact with cognate 
transcripts, which suggests the existence of RNA-dependent factors in its 
function and dysfunction. Indeed, as aggregation is intrinsically concentration 
dependent, it is possible that autogenous interactions play a crucial role in 
controlling protein homeostasis.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) catalyze poly(ADP-ribose) addition onto 
proteins, an important posttranslational modification involved in transcription, 
DNA damage repair, and stem cell identity. Previous studies established the 
activation of PARP1 in response to DNA damage, but little is known about PARP1 
regulation outside of DNA repair. We developed an assay for measuring PARP 
activity in cell lysates and found that the basal activity of PARP1 was highly 
variable across breast cancer cell lines, independent of DNA damage. Sucrose 
gradient fractionation demonstrated that PARP1 existed in at least three 
biochemically distinct states in both high- and low-activity lines. A discovered 
complex containing the NuA4 chromatin-remodeling complex and PARP1 was 
responsible for high basal PARP1 activity, and NuA4 subunits were required for 
this activity. These findings present a pathway for PARP1 activation and a 
direct link between PARP1 and chromatin remodeling outside of the DNA damage 
response.

Polylactic acid (PLA) is an important renewable polymer, but current processes 
for producing its precursor, lactic acid, suffer from process inefficiencies 
related to the use of bacterial hosts. Therefore, improving the capacity of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce lactic acid is a promising approach to 
improve industrial production of lactic acid. As one such improvement required, 
the lactic acid tolerance of yeast must be significantly increased. To enable 
improved tolerance, we employed an RNAi-mediated genome-wide expression 
knockdown approach as a means to rapidly identify potential genetic targets. In 
this approach, several gene knockdown targets were identified which confer 
increased acid tolerance to S. cerevisiae BY4741, of which knockdown of the 
ribosome-associated chaperone SSB1 conferred the highest increase (52%). This 
target was then transferred into a lactic acid-overproducing strain of S. 
cerevisiae CEN.PK in the form of a knockout and the resulting strain 
demonstrated up to 33% increased cell growth, 58% increased glucose consumption, 
and 60% increased L-lactic acid production. As SSB1 contains a close functional 
homolog SSB2 in yeast, this result was counterintuitive and may point to 
as-yet-undefined functional differences between SSB1 and SSB2 related to lactic 
acid production. The final strain produced over 50 g/L of lactic acid in under 
60 h of fermentation.

Gene expression is imperfect, sometimes leading to toxic products. Solutions 
take two forms: globally reducing error rates, or ensuring that the consequences 
of erroneous expression are relatively harmless. The latter is optimal, but 
because it must evolve independently at so many loci, it is subject to a 
stringent "drift barrier"-a limit to how weak the effects of a deleterious 
mutation s can be, while still being effectively purged by selection, expressed 
in terms of the population size N of an idealized population such that purging 
requires s < -1/N In previous work, only large populations evolved the optimal 
local solution, small populations instead evolved globally low error rates, and 
intermediate populations were bistable, with either solution possible. Here, we 
take into consideration the fact that the effectiveness of purging varies among 
loci, because of variation in gene expression level, and variation in the 
intrinsic vulnerabilities of different gene products to error. The previously 
found dichotomy between the two kinds of solution breaks down, replaced by a 
gradual transition as a function of population size. In the extreme case of a 
small enough population, selection fails to maintain even the global solution 
against deleterious mutations, explaining the nonmonotonic relationship between 
effective population size and transcriptional error rate that was recently 
observed in experiments on Escherichia coli, Caenorhabditis elegans, and 
Buchnera aphidicola.

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) have been widely employed to predict 
microorganism behaviors. However, GEMs only consider stoichiometric constraints, 
leading to a linear increase in simulated growth and product yields as substrate 
uptake rates rise. This divergence from experimental measurements prompted the 
creation of enzyme-constrained models (ecModels) for various species, 
successfully enhancing chemical production. Building upon studies that allocate 
macromolecule resources, we developed a Python-based workflow (ECMpy) that 
constructs an enzyme-constrained model. This involves directly imposing an 
enzyme amount constraint in GEM and accounting for protein subunit composition 
in reactions. However, this procedure demands manual collection of enzyme 
kinetic parameter information and subunit composition details, making it rather 
user-unfriendly. In this work, we've enhanced the ECMpy toolbox to version 2.0, 
broadening its scope to automatically generate ecGEMs for a wider array of 
organisms. ECMpy 2.0 automates the retrieval of enzyme kinetic parameters and 
employs machine learning for predicting these parameters, which significantly 
enhances parameter coverage. Additionally, ECMpy 2.0 introduces common 
analytical and visualization features for ecModels, rendering computational 
results more user accessible. Furthermore, ECMpy 2.0 seamlessly integrates three 
published algorithms that exploit ecModels to uncover potential targets for 
metabolic engineering. ECMpy 2.0 is available at https://github.com/tibbdc/ECMpy 
or as a pip package (https://pypi.org/project/ECMpy/).

Mitochondrial protein (MP) dysfunction has been linked to neurodegenerative 
disorders (NDs); however, the discovery of the molecular mechanisms underlying 
NDs has been impeded by the limited characterization of interactions governing 
MP function. Here, using mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of 210 
affinity-purified mitochondrial (mt) fractions isolated from 27 epitope-tagged 
human ND-linked MPs in HEK293 cells, we report a high-confidence MP network 
including 1,964 interactions among 772 proteins (>90% previously unreported). 
Nearly three-fourths of these interactions were confirmed in mouse brain and 
multiple human differentiated neuronal cell lines by primary antibody 
immunoprecipitation and MS, with many linked to NDs and autism. We show that the 
SOD1-PRDX5 interaction, critical for mt redox homeostasis, can be perturbed by 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked SOD1 allelic variants and establish a 
functional role for ND-linked factors coupled with IκBɛ in NF-κB activation. Our 
results identify mechanisms for ND-linked MPs and expand the human mt 
interaction landscape.

It has recently been shown that the organization of genes in eukaryotic genomes, 
and specifically in 3D, is strongly related to gene expression and function and 
partially conserved between organisms. However, previous studies of 3D genomic 
organization analyzed each organism independently from others. Here, we propose 
an approach for unified inter-organismal analysis of gene organization based on 
a network representation of Hi-C data. We define and detect four classes of 
spatially co-evolving orthologous modules (SCOMs), i.e. gene families that 
co-evolve in their 3D organization, based on patterns of divergence and 
conservation of distances. We demonstrate our methodology on Hi-C data from 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and identify, among 
others, modules relating to RNA splicing machinery and chromatin silencing by 
small RNA which are central to S. pombe's lifestyle. Our results emphasize the 
importance of 3D genomic organization in eukaryotes and suggest that the 
evolutionary mechanisms that shape gene organization affect the organism fitness 
and phenotypes. The proposed algorithms can be utilized in future studies of 
genome evolution and comparative analysis of spatial genomic organization in 
different tissues, conditions and single cells.

hydroperoxides, sulfenic acids, and nitrosothiols, (ii) the detoxification of 
aldehydes, xenobiotics, and heavy metals, and (iii) the synthesis of 
eicosanoids, steroids, and iron-sulfur clusters. In addition, glutathione 
affects oxidative protein folding and redox signaling. Here, I try to provide an 
overview on the relevance of glutathione-dependent pathways with an emphasis on 
quantitative data. Recent Advances: Intracellular redox measurements reveal that 
the cytosol, the nucleus, and mitochondria contain very little glutathione 
disulfide and that oxidative challenges are rapidly counterbalanced. Genetic 
approaches suggest that iron metabolism is the centerpiece of the glutathione 
puzzle in yeast. Furthermore, recent biochemical studies provide novel insights 
on glutathione transport processes and uncoupling mechanisms.
CRITICAL ISSUES: Which parts of the glutathione puzzle are most relevant? Does 
this explain the high intracellular concentrations of reduced glutathione? How 
can iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, oxidative protein folding, or redox 
signaling occur at high glutathione concentrations? Answers to these questions 
not only seem to depend on the organism, cell type, and subcellular compartment 
but also on different ideologies among researchers.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: A rational approach to compare the relevance of 
glutathione-dependent pathways is to combine genetic and quantitative kinetic 
data. However, there are still many missing pieces and too little is known about 
the compartment-specific repertoire and concentration of numerous metabolites, 
substrates, enzymes, and transporters as well as rate constants and enzyme 
kinetic patterns. Gathering this information might require the development of 
novel tools but is crucial to address potential kinetic competitions and to 
decipher uncoupling mechanisms to solve the glutathione puzzle. Antioxid. Redox

Natural selection shapes protein solubility to physiological requirements and 
recombinant applications that require higher protein concentrations are often 
problematic. This raises the question whether the solubility of natural protein 
sequences can be improved. We here show an anti-correlation between the number 
of aggregation prone regions (APRs) in a protein sequence and its solubility, 
suggesting that mutational suppression of APRs provides a simple strategy to 
increase protein solubility. We show that mutations at specific positions within 
a protein structure can act as APR suppressors without affecting protein 
stability. These hot spots for protein solubility are both structure and 
sequence dependent but can be computationally predicted. We demonstrate this by 
reducing the aggregation of human α-galactosidase and protective antigen of 
Bacillus anthracis through mutation. Our results indicate that many proteins 
possess hot spots allowing to adapt protein solubility independently of 
structure and function.

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are widely used to calculate metabolic 
phenotypes. They rely on defining a set of constraints, the most common of which 
is that the production of metabolites and/or growth are limited by the carbon 
source uptake rate. However, enzyme abundances and kinetics, which act as 
limitations on metabolic fluxes, are not taken into account. Here, we present 
GECKO, a method that enhances a GEM to account for enzymes as part of reactions, 
thereby ensuring that each metabolic flux does not exceed its maximum capacity, 
equal to the product of the enzyme's abundance and turnover number. We applied 
GECKO to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae GEM and demonstrated that the new model 
could correctly describe phenotypes that the previous model could not, 
particularly under high enzymatic pressure conditions, such as yeast growing on 
different carbon sources in excess, coping with stress, or overexpressing a 
specific pathway. GECKO also allows to directly integrate quantitative 
proteomics data; by doing so, we significantly reduced flux variability of the 
model, in over 60% of metabolic reactions. Additionally, the model gives insight 
into the distribution of enzyme usage between and within metabolic pathways. The 
developed method and model are expected to increase the use of model-based 
design in metabolic engineering.

By providing useful tools to study host-pathogen interactions, next-generation 
omics has recently enabled the study of gene expression changes in both pathogen 
and infected host simultaneously. However, since great discriminative power is 
required to study pathogen and host simultaneously throughout the infection 
process, the depth of quantitative gene expression profiling has proven to be 
unsatisfactory when focusing on bacterial pathogens, thus preferentially 
requiring specific strategies or the development of novel methodologies based on 
complementary omics approaches. In this review, we focus on the difficulties 
encountered when making use of proteogenomics approaches to study bacterial 
pathogenesis. In addition, we review different omics strategies (i.e., 
transcriptomics, proteomics and secretomics) and their applications for studying 
interactions of pathogens with their host.

Global modifier genes influence the mapping of genotypes onto phenotypes and 
fitness through their epistatic interactions with genetic variants on a massive 
scale. The first such factor to be identified, Hsp90, is a highly conserved 
molecular chaperone that plays a central role in protein homeostasis. Hsp90 is a 
"hub of hubs" that chaperones proteins engaged in many key cellular and 
developmental regulatory networks. These clients, which are enriched in kinases, 
transcription factors, and E3 ubiquitin ligases, drive diverse cellular 
functions and are themselves highly connected. By contrast to many other hub 
proteins, the abundance and activity of Hsp90 changes substantially in response 
to shifting environmental conditions. As a result, Hsp90 modifies the functional 
impact of many genetic variants simultaneously in a manner that depends on 
environmental stress. Studies in diverse organisms suggest that this coupling 
between Hsp90 function and challenging environments exerts a substantial impact 
on what parts of the genome are visible to natural selection, expanding adaptive 
opportunities when most needed. In this Perspective, we explore the multifaceted 
role of Hsp90 as global modifier of the genotype-phenotype-fitness map as well 
as its implications for evolution in nature and the clinic.

The RNA helicase UPF1 interacts with mRNAs, mRNA decay machinery, and the 
terminating ribosome to promote nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Structural 
and biochemical data have revealed that UPF1 exists in an enzymatically 
autoinhibited "closed" state. Upon binding the NMD protein UPF2, UPF1 undergoes 
an extensive conformational change into a more enzymatically active "open" 
state, which exhibits enhanced ATPase and helicase activity. However, 
mechanically deficient UPF1 mutants can support efficient NMD, bringing into 
question the roles of UPF1 enzymatic autoinhibition and activation in NMD. Here, 
we identify two additional important features of the activated open state: 
slower nucleic acid binding kinetics and enhanced ATP-stimulated nucleic acid 
dissociation kinetics. Computational modeling based on empirical measurements of 
UPF1, UPF2, and RNA interaction kinetics predicts that the majority of UPF1-RNA 
binding and dissociation events in cells occur independently of UPF2 binding. We 
find that UPF1 mutants with either reduced or accelerated dissociation from RNA 
have NMD defects, whereas UPF1 mutants that are more dependent on UPF2 for 
catalytic activity remain active on well-established NMD targets. These findings 
support a model in which the kinetics of UPF1-mRNA interactions are important 
determinants of cellular NMD efficiency.

Unlike other Hsp70 molecular chaperones, those of the eukaryotic cytosol have 
four residues, EEVD, at their C-termini. EEVD(Hsp70) binds adaptor proteins of 
the Hsp90 chaperone system and mitochondrial membrane preprotein receptors, 
thereby facilitating processing of Hsp70-bound clients through protein folding 
and translocation pathways. Among J-protein co-chaperones functioning in these 
pathways, Sis1 is unique, as it also binds the EEVD(Hsp70) motif. However, 
little is known about the role of the Sis1:EEVD(Hsp70) interaction. We found 
that deletion of EEVD(Hsp70) abolished the ability of Sis1, but not the 
ubiquitous J-protein Ydj1, to partner with Hsp70 in in vitro protein refolding. 
Sis1 co-chaperone activity with Hsp70∆EEVD was restored upon substitution of a 
glutamic acid of the J-domain. Structural analysis revealed that this key 
glutamic acid, which is not present in Ydj1, forms a salt bridge with an 
arginine of the immediately adjacent glycine-rich region. Thus, restoration of 
Sis1 in vitro activity suggests that intramolecular interactions between the 
J-domain and glycine-rich region control co-chaperone activity, which is optimal 
only when Sis1 interacts with the EEVD(Hsp70) motif. However, we found that 
disruption of the Sis1:EEVD(Hsp70) interaction enhances the ability of Sis1 to 
substitute for Ydj1 in vivo. Our results are consistent with the idea that 
interaction of Sis1 with EEVD(Hsp70) minimizes transfer of Sis1-bound clients to 
Hsp70s that are primed for client transfer to folding and translocation pathways 
by their preassociation with EEVD binding adaptor proteins. These interactions 
may be one means by which cells triage Ydj1- and Sis1-bound clients to 
productive and quality control pathways, respectively.

Conventional approaches to identify secreted factors that regulate homeostasis 
are limited in their abilities to identify the tissues/cells of origin and 
destination. We established a platform to identify secreted protein trafficking 
between organs using an engineered biotin ligase (BirA*G3) that biotinylates, 
promiscuously, proteins in a subcellular compartment of one tissue. 
Subsequently, biotinylated proteins are affinity-enriched and identified from 
distal organs using quantitative mass spectrometry. Applying this approach in 
Drosophila, we identify 51 muscle-secreted proteins from heads and 269 fat 
body-secreted proteins from legs/muscles, including CG2145 (human ortholog 
ENDOU) that binds directly to muscles and promotes activity. In addition, in 
mice, we identify 291 serum proteins secreted from conditional BirA*G3 embryo 
stem cell-derived teratomas, including low-abundance proteins with hormonal 
properties. Our findings indicate that the communication network of secreted 
proteins is vast. This approach has broad potential across different model 
systems to identify cell-specific secretomes and mediators of interorgan 
communication in health or disease.

The Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme and the decapping activators Pat1, Dhh1, and Lsm1 
regulate mRNA decapping, but their mechanistic integration is unknown. We 
analyzed the gene expression consequences of deleting PAT1, LSM1, or DHH1, or 
the DCP2 C-terminal domain, and found that: i) the Dcp2 C-terminal domain is an 
effector of both negative and positive regulation; ii) rather than being global 
activators of decapping, Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 directly target specific subsets 
of yeast mRNAs and loss of the functions of each of these factors has 
substantial indirect consequences for genome-wide mRNA expression; and iii) 
transcripts targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 exhibit only partial overlap, are 
generally translated inefficiently, and, as expected, are targeted to 
decapping-dependent decay. Our results define the roles of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 
in decapping of general mRNAs and suggest that these factors may monitor mRNA 
translation and target unique features of individual mRNAs.

Peroxiredoxins efficiently remove hydroperoxides and peroxynitrite in pro- and 
eukaryotes. However, isoforms of one subfamily of peroxiredoxins, the so-called 
Prx6-type enzymes, usually have very low activities in standard peroxidase 
assays in vitro. In contrast to other peroxiredoxins, Prx6 homologues share a 
conserved histidyl residue at the bottom of the active site. Here we addressed 
the role of this histidyl residue for redox catalysis using the Plasmodium 
falciparum homologue PfPrx6 as a model enzyme. Steady-state kinetics with 
tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) revealed that the histidyl residue is 
nonessential for Prx6 catalysis and that a replacement with tyrosine can even 
increase the enzyme activity four- to six-fold in vitro. Stopped-flow kinetics 
with reduced PfPrx6WT , PfPrx6C128A , and PfPrx6H39Y revealed a preference for 
H2 O2 as an oxidant with second order rate constants for H2 O2 and tBuOOH around 
2.5 × 107 M-1 s-1 and 3 × 106 M-1 s-1 , respectively. Differences between the 
oxidation kinetics of PfPrx6WT , PfPrx6C128A , and PfPrx6H39Y were observed 
during a slower second-reaction phase. Our kinetic data support the 
interpretation that the reductive half-reaction is the rate-limiting step for 
PfPrx6 catalysis in steady-state measurements. Whether the increased activity of 
PfPrx6H39Y is caused by a facilitated enzyme reduction because of a 
destabilization of the fully folded enzyme conformation remains to be analyzed. 
In summary, the conserved histidyl residue of Prx6-type enzymes is non-essential 
for catalysis, PfPrx6 is rapidly oxidized by hydroperoxides, and the 
gain-of-function mutant PfPrx6H39Y might provide a valuable tool to address the 
influence of conformational changes on the reactivity of Prx6 homologues.

Heterologously expressed genes require adaptation to the host organism to ensure 
adequate levels of protein synthesis, which is typically approached by replacing 
codons by the target organism's preferred codons. In view of frequently 
encountered suboptimal outcomes we introduce the codon-specific elongation model 
(COSEM) as an alternative concept. COSEM simulates ribosome dynamics during mRNA 
translation and informs about protein synthesis rates per mRNA in an organism- 
and context-dependent way. Protein synthesis rates from COSEM are integrated 
with further relevant covariates such as translation accuracy into a protein 
expression score that we use for codon optimization. The scoring algorithm 
further enables fine-tuning of protein expression including deoptimization and 
is implemented in the software OCTOPOS. The protein expression score produces 
competitive predictions on proteomic data from prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and 
human expression systems. In addition, we optimized and tested heterologous

Protein glycosylation is ubiquitous in biological systems and essential for cell 
survival. However, the heterogeneity of glycans and the low abundance of many 
glycoproteins complicate their global analysis. Chemical methods based on 
reversible covalent interactions between boronic acid and glycans have great 
potential to enrich glycopeptides, but the binding affinity is typically not 
strong enough to capture low-abundance species. Here, we develop a strategy 
using dendrimer-conjugated benzoboroxole to enhance the glycopeptide enrichment. 
We test the performance of several boronic acid derivatives, showing that 
benzoboroxole markedly increases glycopeptide coverage from human cell lysates. 
The enrichment is further improved by conjugating benzoboroxole to a dendrimer, 
which enables synergistic benzoboroxole-glycan interactions. This robust and 
simple method is highly effective for sensitive glycoproteomics analysis, 
especially capturing low-abundance glycopeptides. Importantly, the enriched 
glycopeptides remain intact, making the current method compatible with 
mass-spectrometry-based approaches to identify glycosylation sites and glycan 
structures.

Cell compartmentalization serves both the isolation and the specialization of 
cell functions. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, over a third of all proteins 
are targeted to other subcellular compartments. Knowing how proteins are 
distributed within the cell and how they interact is a prerequisite for 
understanding it as a whole. Surface and secreted proteins are important 
pathogenicity determinants. Here we present the STEP database (STEPdb) that 
contains a comprehensive characterization of subcellular localization and 
topology of the complete proteome of Escherichia coli. Two widely used E. coli 
proteomes (K-12 and BL21) are presented organized into thirteen subcellular 
classes. STEPdb exploits the wealth of genetic, proteomic, biochemical, and 
functional information on protein localization, secretion, and targeting in E. 
coli, one of the best understood model organisms. Subcellular annotations were 
derived from a combination of bioinformatics prediction, proteomic, biochemical, 
functional, topological data and extensive literature re-examination that were 
refined through manual curation. Strong experimental support for the location of 
1553 out of 4303 proteins was based on 426 articles and some experimental 
indications for another 526. Annotations were provided for another 320 proteins 
based on firm bioinformatic predictions. STEPdb is the first database that 
contains an extensive set of peripheral IM proteins (PIM proteins) and includes 
their graphical visualization into complexes, cellular functions, and 
interactions. It also summarizes all currently known protein export machineries 
of E. coli K-12 and pairs them, where available, with the secretory proteins 
that use them. It catalogs the Sec- and TAT-utilizing secretomes and summarizes 
their topological features such as signal peptides and transmembrane regions, 
transmembrane topologies and orientations. It also catalogs physicochemical and 
structural features that influence topology such as abundance, solubility, 
disorder, heat resistance, and structural domain families. Finally, STEPdb 
incorporates prediction tools for topology (TMHMM, SignalP, and Phobius) and 
disorder (IUPred) and implements the BLAST2STEP that performs protein homology 
searches against the STEPdb.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a key regulatory modification in metazoans, 
and the corresponding kinase enzymes have diversified dramatically. This 
diversification is correlated with a genome-wide reduction in protein tyrosine 
content, and it was recently suggested that this reduction was driven by 
selection to avoid promiscuous phosphorylation that might be deleterious. We 
tested three predictions of this intriguing hypothesis. 1) Selection should be 
stronger on residues that are more likely to be phosphorylated due to local 
solvent accessibility or structural disorder. 2) Selection should be stronger on 
proteins that are more likely to be promiscuously phosphorylated because they 
are abundant. We tested these predictions by comparing distributions of tyrosine 
within and among human and yeast orthologous proteins. 3) Selection should be 
stronger against mutations that create tyrosine versus remove tyrosine. We 
tested this prediction using human population genomic variation data. We found 
that all three predicted effects are modest for tyrosine when compared with the 
other amino acids, suggesting that selection against deleterious phosphorylation 
was not dominant in driving metazoan tyrosine loss.

Protein noise measurements are increasingly used to elucidate biophysical 
parameters. Unfortunately noise analyses are often at odds with directly 
measured parameters. Here we show that these inconsistencies arise from two 
problematic analytical choices: (i) the assumption that protein translation rate 
is invariant for different proteins of different abundances, which has 
inadvertently led to (ii) the assumption that a large constitutive extrinsic 
noise sets the low noise limit in gene expression. While growing evidence 
suggests that transcriptional bursting may set the low noise limit, variability 
in translational bursting has been largely ignored. We show that genome-wide 
systematic variation in translational efficiency can-and in the case of E. coli 
does-control the low noise limit in gene expression. Therefore constitutive 
extrinsic noise is small and only plays a role in the absence of a systematic 
variation in translational efficiency. These results show the existence of two 
distinct expression noise patterns: (1) a global noise floor uniformly imposed 
on all genes by expression bursting; and (2) high noise distributed to only a 
select group of genes.

The 3' end of the small ribosomal RNAs (ssu rRNA) in bacteria is directly 
involved in the selection and binding of mRNA transcripts during translation 
initiation via well-documented interactions between a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) 
sequence located upstream of the initiation codon and an anti-SD (aSD) sequence 
at the 3' end of the ssu rRNA. Consequently, the 3' end of ssu rRNA (3'TAIL) is 
strongly conserved among bacterial species because a change in the region may 
impact the translation of many protein-coding genes. Escherichia coli and 
Bacillus subtilis differ in their 3' ends of ssu rRNA, being GAUCACCUCCUUA3' in 
E. coli and GAUCACCUCCUUUCU3' or GAUCACCUCCUUUCUA3' in B. subtilis Such 
differences in 3'TAIL lead to species-specific SDs (designated SDEc for E. coli 
and SDBs for B. subtilis) that can form strong and well-positioned SD/aSD 
pairing in one species but not in the other. Selection mediated by the 
species-specific 3'TAIL is expected to favor SDBs against SDEc in B. subtilis, 
but favor SDEc against SDBs in E. coli Among well-positioned SDs, SDEc is used 
more in E. coli than in B. subtilis, and SDBs more in B. subtilis than in E. 
coli Highly expressed genes and genes of high translation efficiency tend to 
have longer SDs than lowly expressed genes and genes with low translation 
efficiency in both species, but more so in B. subtilis than in E. coli Both 
species overuse SDs matching the bolded part of the 3'TAIL shown above. The 
3'TAIL difference contributes to the host specificity of phages.

Kinases catalyze protein phosphorylation to regulate cell signaling events. 
However, identifying kinase substrates is challenging due to the often low 
abundance and dynamic nature of protein phosphorylation. Development of novel 
techniques to identify kinase substrates is necessary. Here, we report 
kinase-catalyzed biotinylation with inactivated lysates for discovery of 
substrates (K-BILDS) as a tool to identify direct substrates of a kinase. As a 
proof of concept, K-BILDS was applied to cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) 
with HeLa cell lysates. Subsequent enrichment and MS/MS analysis identified 279 
candidate PKA substrates, including 56 previously known PKA substrates. Of the 
candidate substrates, nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP), 
BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), and 14-3-3 protein Tau (YWHAQ) were 
validated as novel PKA substrates. K-BILDS provides a valuable tool to identify 
direct substrates of any protein kinase.

The low costs of array-synthesized oligonucleotide libraries are empowering 
rapid advances in quantitative and synthetic biology. However, high synthesis 
error rates, uneven representation, and lack of access to individual 
oligonucleotides limit the true potential of these libraries. We have developed 
a cost-effective method called Recombinase Directed Indexing (REDI), which 
involves integration of a complex library into yeast, site-specific 
recombination to index library DNA, and next-generation sequencing to identify 
desired clones. We used REDI to generate a library of ~3,300 DNA probes that 
exhibited > 96% purity and remarkable uniformity (> 95% of probes within twofold 
of the median abundance). Additionally, we created a collection of ~9,000 
individually accessible CRISPR interference yeast strains for > 99% of genes 
required for either fermentative or respiratory growth, demonstrating the 
utility of REDI for rapid and cost-effective creation of strain collections from 
oligonucleotide pools. Our approach is adaptable to any complex DNA library, and 
fundamentally changes how these libraries can be parsed, maintained, propagated, 
and characterized.

Growing cells coordinate protein translation with metabolic rates. Central to 
this coordination is ribosome production. Ribosomes drive cell growth, but 
translation of ribosomal proteins competes with production of non-ribosomal 
proteins. Theory shows that cell growth is maximized when all expressed 
ribosomes are constantly translating. To examine whether budding yeast function 
at this limit of full ribosomal usage, we profiled the proteomes of cells 
growing in different environments. We find that cells produce excess ribosomal 
proteins, amounting to a constant ≈8% of the proteome. Accordingly, ≈25% of 
ribosomal proteins expressed in rapidly growing cells does not contribute to 
translation. Further, this fraction increases as growth rate decreases and these 
excess ribosomal proteins are employed when translation demands unexpectedly 
increase. We suggest that steadily growing cells prepare for conditions that 
demand increased translation by producing excess ribosomes, at the expense of 
lower steady-state growth rate.

Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor throughout biology. The first 
committed step in the CoA synthetic pathway is synthesis of β-alanine from 
aspartate. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica panD encodes the 
responsible enzyme, aspartate-1-decarboxylase, as a proenzyme. To become active, 
the E. coli and S. enterica PanD proenzymes must undergo an autocatalytic 
cleavage to form the pyruvyl cofactor that catalyzes decarboxylation. A problem 
was that the autocatalytic cleavage was too slow to support growth. A 
long-neglected gene (now called panZ) was belatedly found to encode the protein 
that increases autocatalytic cleavage of the PanD proenzyme to a physiologically 
relevant rate. PanZ must bind CoA or acetyl-CoA to interact with the PanD 
proenzyme and accelerate cleavage. The CoA/acetyl-CoA dependence has led to 
proposals that the PanD-PanZ CoA/acetyl-CoA interaction regulates CoA synthesis. 
Unfortunately, regulation of β-alanine synthesis is very weak or absent. 
However, the PanD-PanZ interaction provides an explanation for the toxicity of 
the CoA anti-metabolite, N5-pentyl pantothenamide.

Human cytotoxic lymphocytes kill intracellular microbes. The cytotoxic granule 
granzyme proteases released by cytotoxic lymphocytes trigger oxidative bacterial 
death by disrupting electron transport, generating superoxide anion and 
inactivating bacterial oxidative defenses. However, they also cause 
non-oxidative cell death because anaerobic bacteria are also killed. Here, we 
use differential proteomics to identify granzyme B substrates in three unrelated 
bacteria: Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycobacteria 
tuberculosis. Granzyme B cleaves a highly conserved set of proteins in all three 
bacteria, which function in vital biosynthetic and metabolic pathways that are 
critical for bacterial survival under diverse environmental conditions. Key 
proteins required for protein synthesis, folding, and degradation are also 
substrates, including multiple aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, ribosomal proteins, 
protein chaperones, and the Clp system. Because killer cells use a multipronged 
strategy to target vital pathways, bacteria may not easily become resistant to 
killer cell attack.

Universal distribution of mutational effects on protein stability, uncoupling of 
protein robustness from sequence evolution and distinct evolutionary modes of 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins.

Robustness to destabilizing effects of mutations is thought of as a key factor 
of protein evolution. The connections between two measures of robustness, the 
relative core size and the computationally estimated effect of mutations on 
protein stability (ΔΔG), protein abundance and the selection pressure on 
protein-coding genes (dN/dS) were analyzed for the organisms with a large number 
of available protein structures including four eukaryotes, two bacteria and one 
archaeon. The distribution of the effects of mutations in the core on protein 
stability is universal and indistinguishable in eukaryotes and bacteria, 
centered at slightly destabilizing amino acid replacements, and with a heavy 
tail of more strongly destabilizing replacements. The distribution of mutational 
effects in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus gammatolerans is 
significantly shifted toward strongly destabilizing replacements which is 
indicative of stronger constraints that are imposed on proteins in 
hyperthermophiles. The median effect of mutations is strongly, positively 
correlated with the relative core size, in evidence of the congruence between 
the two measures of protein robustness. However, both measures show only limited 
correlations to the expression level and selection pressure on protein-coding 
genes. Thus, the degree of robustness reflected in the universal distribution of 
mutational effects appears to be a fundamental, ancient feature of globular 
protein folds whereas the observed variations are largely neutral and uncoupled 
from short term protein evolution. A weak anticorrelation between protein core 
size and selection pressure is observed only for surface residues in prokaryotes 
but a stronger anticorrelation is observed for all residues in eukaryotic 
proteins. This substantial difference between proteins of prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes is likely to stem from the demonstrable higher compactness of 
prokaryotic proteins.
