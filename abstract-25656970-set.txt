Protein quantification at proteome-wide scale is an important aim, enabling 
insights into fundamental cellular biology and serving to constrain experiments 
and theoretical models. While proteome-wide quantification is not yet fully 
routine, many datasets approaching proteome-wide coverage are becoming available 
through biophysical and MS techniques. Data of this type can be accessed via a 
variety of sources, including publication supplements and online data 
repositories. However, access to the data is still fragmentary, and comparisons 
across experiments and organisms are not straightforward. Here, we describe 
recent updates to our database resource "PaxDb" (Protein Abundances Across 
Organisms). PaxDb focuses on protein abundance information at proteome-wide 
scope, irrespective of the underlying measurement technique. Quantification data 
is reprocessed, unified, and quality-scored, and then integrated to build a 
meta-resource. PaxDb also allows evolutionary comparisons through precomputed 
gene orthology relations. Recently, we have expanded the scope of the database 
to include cell-line samples, and more systematically scan the literature for 
suitable datasets. We report that a significant fraction of published 
experiments cannot readily be accessed and/or parsed for quantitative 
information, requiring additional steps and efforts. The current update brings 
PaxDb to 414 datasets in 53 organisms, with (semi-) quantitative abundance 
information covering more than 300,000 proteins.

Most aging hypotheses assume the accumulation of damage, resulting in gradual 
physiological decline and, ultimately, death. Avoiding protein damage 
accumulation by enhanced turnover should slow down the aging process and extend 
the lifespan. However, lowering translational efficiency extends rather than 
shortens the lifespan in C. elegans. We studied turnover of individual proteins 
in the long-lived daf-2 mutant by combining SILeNCe (stable isotope labeling by 
nitrogen in Caenorhabditiselegans) and mass spectrometry. Intriguingly, the 
majority of proteins displayed prolonged half-lives in daf-2, whereas others 
remained unchanged, signifying that longevity is not supported by high protein 
turnover. This slowdown was most prominent for translation-related and 
mitochondrial proteins. In contrast, the high turnover of lysosomal hydrolases 
and very low turnover of cytoskeletal proteins remained largely unchanged. The 
slowdown of protein dynamics and decreased abundance of the translational 
machinery may point to the importance of anabolic attenuation in lifespan 
extension, as suggested by the hyperfunction theory.

Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic loci linked to 
coronary artery disease (CAD) most of them located in non-protein coding regions 
of the genome. One such locus is the CAD Associated Region between MFGE8 and 
ABHD2 (CARMA), a ∼18 kb haplotype that was recently shown to regulate vicinal 
protein coding genes. Here, we further investigate the region by examining a 
long non-coding RNA gene locus (CARMAL/RP11-326A19.4/AC013565) abutting the 
CARMA region. Expression-genotype correlation analyses of public databases 
indicate that CARMAL levels are influenced by CAD associated variants suggesting 
that it might have cardioprotective functions. We found CARMAL to be stably 
expressed at relatively low levels and enriched in the cytosol. CARMAL function 
was investigated by several gene targeting approaches in HEK293T: inactive 
CRISPR fusion proteins, antisense, overexpression and inactivation by 
CRISPR-mediated knock-out. Modest increases in CARMAL (3-4×) obtained via 
CRISPRa using distinct single-guided RNAs did not result in consistent 
transcriptome effects. By contrast, CARMAL deletion or reduced CARMAL expression 
via CRISPRi increased MFGE8 levels, suggesting that CARMAL is contributing to 
reduce MFGE8 expression under basal conditions. While future investigations are 
required to clarify the mechanism(s) by which CARMAL acts on MFGE8, integrative 
bioinformatic analyses of the transcriptome of CARMAL deleted cells suggest that 
this locus may also be involved in leucine metabolism, splicing, transcriptional 
regulation and Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome protein function.

Glycosylation greatly influences the safety and efficacy of many of the 
highest-selling recombinant therapeutic proteins (rTPs). In order to define 
optimal cell culture feeding strategies that control rTP glycosylation, it is 
necessary to know how nucleotide sugars (NSs) are consumed towards host cell and 
rTP glycosylation. Here, we present a theoretical framework that integrates the 
reported glycoproteome of CHO cells, the number of N-linked and O-GalNAc 
glycosylation sites on individual host cell proteins (HCPs), and the 
carbohydrate content of CHO glycosphingolipids to estimate the demand of NSs 
towards CHO cell glycosylation. We have identified the most abundant N-linked 
and O-GalNAc CHO glycoproteins, obtained the weighted frequency of N-linked and 
O-GalNAc glycosites across the CHO cell proteome, and have derived 
stoichiometric coefficients for NS consumption towards CHO cell glycosylation. 
By combining the obtained stoichiometric coefficients with previously reported 
data for specific growth and productivity of CHO cells, we observe that the 
demand of NSs towards glycosylation is significant and, thus, is required to 
better understand the burden of glycosylation on cellular metabolism. The 
estimated demand of NSs towards CHO cell glycosylation can be used to rationally 
design feeding strategies that ensure optimal and consistent rTP glycosylation.

Methionine oxidation plays a relevant role in cell signaling. Recently, we built 
a database containing thousands of proteins identified as sulfoxidation targets. 
Using this resource, we have now developed a computational approach aimed at 
characterizing the oxidation of human methionyl residues. We found that proteins 
oxidized in both cell-free preparations (in vitro) and inside living cells (ex 
vivo) were enriched in methionines and intrinsically disordered regions. 
However, proteins oxidized ex vivo tended to be larger and less abundant than 
those oxidized in vitro. Another distinctive feature was their subcellular 
localizations. Thus, nuclear and mitochondrial proteins were preferentially 
oxidized ex vivo but not in vitro. The nodes corresponding with ex vivo and in 
vitro oxidized proteins in a network based on gene ontology terms showed an 
assortative mixing suggesting that ex vivo oxidized proteins shared among them 
molecular functions and biological processes. This was further supported by the 
observation that proteins from the ex vivo set were co-regulated more often than 
expected by chance. We also investigated the sequence environment of oxidation 
sites. Glutamate and aspartate were overrepresented in these environments 
regardless the group. In contrast, tyrosine, tryptophan and histidine were 
clearly avoided but only in the environments of the ex vivo sites. A 
hypothetical mechanism of methionine oxidation accounts for these observations 
presented.

Details of the functional mechanisms of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) 
in living cells is an area not frequently investigated. Here, we dissect the 
molecular mechanism of action of an IDP in cells by detailed structural analyses 
based on an in-cell nuclear magnetic resonance experiment. We show that the ID 
stress protein (IDSP) A. thaliana Early Response to Dehydration (ERD14) is 
capable of protecting E. coli cells under heat stress. The overexpression of 
ERD14 increases the viability of E. coli cells from 38.9% to 73.9% following 
heat stress (50 °C × 15 min). We also provide evidence that the protection is 
mainly achieved by protecting the proteome of the cells. In-cell NMR experiments 
performed in E. coli cells show that the protective activity is associated with 
a largely disordered structural state with conserved, short sequence motifs (K- 
and H-segments), which transiently sample helical conformations in vitro and 
engage in partner binding in vivo. Other regions of the protein, such as its S 
segment and its regions linking and flanking the binding motifs, remain unbound 
and disordered in the cell. Our data suggest that the cellular function of ERD14 
is compatible with its residual structural disorder in vivo.

Proteins and RNAs assemble in membrane-less organelles that organize 
intracellular spaces and regulate biochemical reactions. The ability of proteins 
and RNAs to form condensates is encoded in their sequences, yet it is unknown 
which domains drive the phase separation (PS) process and what are their 
specific roles. Here, we systematically investigated the human and yeast 
proteomes to find regions promoting condensation. Using advanced computational 
methods to predict the PS propensity of proteins, we designed a set of 
experiments to investigate the contributions of Prion-Like Domains (PrLDs) and 
RNA-binding domains (RBDs). We found that one PrLD is sufficient to drive PS, 
whereas multiple RBDs are needed to modulate the dynamics of the assemblies. In 
the case of stress granule protein Pub1 we show that the PrLD promotes 
sequestration of protein partners and the RBD confers liquid-like behaviour to 
the condensate. Our work sheds light on the fine interplay between RBDs and PrLD 
to regulate formation of membrane-less organelles, opening up the avenue for 
their manipulation.

microRNAs (miRNAs) are potent regulators of gene expression that function in a 
variety of developmental and physiological processes by dampening the expression 
of their target genes at a post-transcriptional level. In many gene regulatory 
networks (GRNs), miRNAs function in a switch-like manner whereby their 
expression and activity elicit a transition from one stable pattern of gene 
expression to a distinct, equally stable pattern required to define a nascent 
cell fate. While the importance of miRNAs that function in this capacity are 
clear, we have less of an understanding of the cellular factors and mechanisms 
that ensure the robustness of this form of regulatory bistability. In a screen 
to identify suppressors of temporal patterning phenotypes that result from 
ineffective miRNA-mediated target repression, we identified pqn-59, an ortholog 
of human UBAP2L, as a novel factor that antagonizes the activities of multiple 
heterochronic miRNAs. Specifically, we find that depletion of pqn-59 can restore 
normal development in animals with reduced lin-4 and let-7-family miRNA 
activity. Importantly, inactivation of pqn-59 is not sufficient to bypass the 
requirement of these regulatory RNAs within the heterochronic GRN. The pqn-59 
gene encodes an abundant, cytoplasmically-localized, unstructured protein that 
harbors three essential "prion-like" domains. These domains exhibit LLPS 
properties in vitro and normally function to limit PQN-59 diffusion in the 
cytoplasm in vivo. Like human UBAP2L, PQN-59's localization becomes highly 
dynamic during stress conditions where it re-distributes to cytoplasmic stress 
granules and is important for their formation. Proteomic analysis of PQN-59 
complexes from embryonic extracts indicates that PQN-59 and human UBAP2L 
interact with orthologous cellular components involved in RNA metabolism and 
promoting protein translation and that PQN-59 additionally interacts with 
proteins involved in transcription and intracellular transport. Finally, we 
demonstrate that pqn-59 depletion reduces protein translation and also results 
in the stabilization of several mature miRNAs (including those involved in 
temporal patterning). These data suggest that PQN-59 may ensure the bistability 
of some GRNs that require miRNA functions by promoting miRNA turnover and, like 
UBAP2L, enhancing protein translation.

Precision medicine promises to overcome the constraints of the traditional 
"one-for-all" healthcare approach through a clear understanding of the molecular 
features of a disease, allowing for innovative and tailored treatments. 
State-of-the-art proteomics has the potential to accurately explore the human 
proteome to identify, quantify, and characterize proteins associated with 
disease progression. There is a pressing need for informative biomarkers to 
diagnose liver disease early in its course to prevent severe disease for which 
no efficient treatment is yet available. Here, we propose the concept of a 
cellular pathway as a functional biomarker, whose monitorization may inform 
normal and pathological status. We have developed a standardized targeted 
selected-reaction monitoring assay to detect and quantify 13 enzymes of 
one-carbon metabolism (1CM). The assay is compliant with Clinical Proteomics 
Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) guidelines and has been included in the 
protein quantification assays that can be accessed through the assay portal at 
the CPTAC web page. To test the feasibility of the assay, we conducted a 
retrospective, proof-of-concept study on a collection of liver samples from 
healthy controls and from patients with cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). Our results indicate a significant reconfiguration of 1CM upon HCC 
development resulting from a process that can already be identified in 
cirrhosis. Our findings indicate that the systematic and integrated 
quantification of 1CM enzymes is a promising cell function-based biomarker for 
patient stratification, although further experiments with larger cohorts are 
needed to confirm these findings.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most common genetic cause of bone marrow failure and 
is caused by inherited pathogenic variants in any of 22 genes. Of these, only 
FANCB is X-linked. We describe a cohort of 19 children with FANCB variants, from 
16 families of the International Fanconi Anemia Registry. Those with FANCB 
deletion or truncation demonstrate earlier-than-average onset of bone marrow 
failure and more severe congenital abnormalities compared with a large series of 
FA individuals in published reports. This reflects the indispensable role of 
FANCB protein in the enzymatic activation of FANCD2 monoubiquitination, an 
essential step in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks. For FANCB missense 
variants, more variable severity is associated with the extent of residual 
FANCD2 monoubiquitination activity. We used transcript analysis, genetic 
complementation, and biochemical reconstitution of FANCD2 monoubiquitination to 
determine the pathogenicity of each variant. Aberrant splicing and transcript 
destabilization were associated with 2 missense variants. Individuals carrying 
missense variants with drastically reduced FANCD2 monoubiquitination in 
biochemical and/or cell-based assays tended to show earlier onset of hematologic 
disease and shorter survival. Conversely, variants with near-normal FANCD2 
monoubiquitination were associated with more favorable outcome. Our study 
reveals a genotype-phenotype correlation within the FA-B complementation group 
of FA, where severity is associated with level of residual FANCD2 
monoubiquitination.

Modes of evolution of stop codons in protein-coding genes, especially the 
conservation of UAA, have been debated for many years. We reconstructed the 
evolution of stop codons in 40 groups of closely related prokaryotic and 
eukaryotic genomes. The results indicate that the UAA codons are maintained by 
purifying selection in all domains of life. In contrast, positive selection 
appears to drive switches from UAG to other stop codons in prokaryotes but not 
in eukaryotes. Changes in stop codons are significantly associated with 
increased substitution frequency immediately downstream of the stop. These 
positions are otherwise more strongly conserved in evolution compared to sites 
farther downstream, suggesting that such substitutions are compensatory. 
Although GC content has a major impact on stop codon frequencies, its 
contribution to the decreased frequency of UAA differs between bacteria and 
archaea, presumably, due to differences in their translation termination 
mechanisms.

Phosphorelays are signal transduction circuits that sense environmental changes 
and adjust cellular metabolism. Five different circuit architectures account for 
99% of all phosphorelay operons annotated in over 9,000 fully sequenced genomes. 
Here we asked what biological design principles, if any, could explain selection 
among those architectures in nature. We began by studying kinetically well 
characterized phosphorelays (Spo0 of Bacillus subtilis and Sln1 of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae). We find that natural circuit architecture maximizes information 
transmission in both cases. We use mathematical models to compare information 
transmission among the architectures for a realistic range of concentration and 
parameter values. Mapping experimentally determined phosphorelay protein 
concentrations onto that range reveals that the native architecture maximizes 
information transmission in sixteen out of seventeen analyzed phosphorelays. 
These results suggest that maximization of information transmission is important 
in the selection of native phosphorelay architectures, parameter values and 
protein concentrations.

Bacterial translation initiation is influenced by base pairing between the 
Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in the 5' UTR of mRNA and the anti-SD (aSD) 
sequence at the free 3' end of the 16S rRNA (3' TAIL) due to: 1) the SD/aSD 
sequence binding location and 2) SD/aSD binding affinity. In order to understand 
what makes an SD/aSD interaction optimal, we must define: 1) terminus of the 3' 
TAIL and 2) extent of the core aSD sequence within the 3' TAIL. Our approach to 
characterize these components in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis involves 
1) mapping the 3' boundary of the mature 16S rRNA using high-throughput RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq), and 2) identifying the segment within the 3' TAIL that is 
strongly preferred in SD/aSD pairing. Using RNA-Seq data, we resolve previous 
discrepancies in the reported 3' TAIL in B. subtilis and recovered the 
established 3' TAIL in E. coli. Furthermore, we extend previous studies to 
suggest that both highly and lowly expressed genes favor SD sequences with 
intermediate binding affinity, but this trend is exclusive to SD sequences that 
complement the core aSD sequences defined herein.

DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for 
reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains 
(NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD+ (oxidized form of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein 
interactions. The binding of NAD+ to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast 
cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) 
polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD+ concentrations 
decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, 
a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD+ Thus, NAD+ 
directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may 
protect against cancer, radiation, and aging.

Cellular life depends on a complex web of functional associations between 
biomolecules. Among these associations, protein-protein interactions are 
particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. 
The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations 
between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional 
associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number 
of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) 
databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) 
computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved 
genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one 
organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of 
the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we 
describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical 
interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, 
extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query 
STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of 
enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data. The 
STRING resource is available online, at https://string-db.org/.

Charged multivesicular body protein 2B is a subunit of the endosomal sorting 
complex required for transport III (ESRCT-III), a complex implicated in the 
lysosomal degradation pathway and formation of multivesicular bodies. Mutations 
to the CHMP2B gene can result in abnormal protein aggregates in neurons and is 
therefore predicted to be associated in neurodegenerative diseases, including 
across the ALS-FTD spectrum. Through our standardized experimental protocol 
which compares read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls, 
this study aims to enhance the reproducibility of research on this target by 
characterizing eight commercial antibodies against charged multivesicular body 
protein 2b using Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. We 
identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage readers to use this 
report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific 
needs.

Cell Compartment is a Predictor of Protein Rate of Evolution, but not in the 
Manner Expected: Evidence Against the Extended Complexity Hypothesis.

What accounts for the variation between proteins in their rate of evolution per 
synonymous substitution (i.e. dN/dS, alias ω)? Previous analyses suggested that 
cell location is predictive, with intracellular proteins evolving slower than 
membrane proteins, a result considered supportive of the extended complexity 
hypothesis. However, as they occur in 3D space, cytoplasmic proteins are 
expected to be more abundant. As the level of gene expression is the strongest 
predictor of ω, and many predictors of protein rate variation are explained by 
covariance with it, here we ask whether the cell compartment effect is explained 
by covariates. We employ two single-celled species for which there exist 
exceptional data, the bacterium (Escherichia coli) and the eukaryote 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). For both, we establish informative species trios to 
determine branch-specific ω values. In both species, in the absence of covariate 
control, cytoplasmic proteins evolve relatively slowly, while membrane proteins 
evolve fast, as originally claimed. After controlling for protein abundance, 
however, membrane proteins have the lowest rates, this inversion being resilient 
to multiple alternative abundance control methods. The effect size of the cell 
compartment as a predictor is of a comparable magnitude to the essentiality 
effect and remains when allowing for essentiality. We conclude that the effects 
of the cell compartments are real, but their direction is dependent on the 
presence or absence of abundance control. These results question any model, such 
as the extended complexity hypothesis, that claims support from a slower 
evolution of cytoplasmic proteins and underscore the importance of covariate 
control.

Despite its greener credentials, biomanufacturing remains financially 
uncompetitive compared with the higher carbon emitting, hydrocarbon-based 
chemical industry. Replacing traditional chassis such as E. coli with novel 
robust organisms, are a route to cost reduction for biomanufacturing. 
Extremophile bacteria such as the halophilic Halomonas bluephagenesis TD01 
exemplify this potential by thriving in environments inherently inimical to 
other organisms, so reducing sterilisation costs. Novel chassis are inevitably 
less well annotated than established organisms. Rapid characterisation along 
with community data sharing will facilitate adoption of such organisms for 
biomanufacturing. The data record comprises a newly sequenced genome for the 
organism and evidence via LC-MS based proteomics for expression of 1160 proteins 
(30% of the proteome) including baseline quantification of 1063 proteins (27% of 
the proteome), and a spectral library enabling re-use for targeted LC-MS 
proteomics assays. Protein data are annotated with KEGG Orthology, enabling 
rapid matching of quantitative data to pathways of interest to biomanufacturing.

The interplay between nutrient-induced signaling and metabolism plays an 
important role in maintaining homeostasis and its malfunction has been 
implicated in many different human diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
cancer, and neurological disorders. Therefore, unraveling the role of nutrients 
as signaling molecules and metabolites together with their interconnectivity may 
provide a deeper understanding of how these conditions occur. Both signaling and 
metabolism have been extensively studied using various systems biology 
approaches. However, they are mainly studied individually and in addition, 
current models lack both the complexity of the dynamics and the effects of the 
crosstalk in the signaling system. To gain a better understanding of the 
interconnectivity between nutrient signaling and metabolism in yeast cells, we 
developed a hybrid model, combining a Boolean module, describing the main 
pathways of glucose and nitrogen signaling, and an enzyme-constrained model 
accounting for the central carbon metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using 
a regulatory network as a link. The resulting hybrid model was able to capture a 
diverse utalization of isoenzymes and to our knowledge outperforms 
constraint-based models in the prediction of individual enzymes for both 
respiratory and mixed metabolism. The model showed that during fermentation, 
enzyme utilization has a major contribution in governing protein allocation, 
while in low glucose conditions robustness and control are prioritized. In 
addition, the model was capable of reproducing the regulatory effects that are 
associated with the Crabtree effect and glucose repression, as well as 
regulatory effects associated with lifespan increase during caloric restriction. 
Overall, we show that our hybrid model provides a comprehensive framework for 
the study of the non-trivial effects of the interplay between signaling and 
metabolism, suggesting connections between the Snf1 signaling pathways and 
processes that have been related to chronological lifespan of yeast cells.

Studying emerging or neglected pathogens is often challenging due to 
insufficient information and absence of genetic tools. Dual RNA-seq provides 
insights into host-pathogen interactions, and is particularly informative for 
intracellular organisms. Here we apply dual RNA-seq to Orientia tsutsugamushi 
(Ot), an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes the vector-borne human 
disease scrub typhus. Half the Ot genome is composed of repetitive DNA, and 
there is minimal collinearity in gene order between strains. Integrating 
RNA-seq, comparative genomics, proteomics, and machine learning to study the 
transcriptional architecture of Ot, we find evidence for wide-spread 
post-transcriptional antisense regulation. Comparing the host response to two 
clinical isolates, we identify distinct immune response networks for each 
strain, leading to predictions of relative virulence that are validated in a 
mouse infection model. Thus, dual RNA-seq can provide insight into the biology 
and host-pathogen interactions of a poorly characterized and genetically 
intractable organism such as Ot.

The seven 14-3-3 isoforms are highly abundant human proteins encoded by similar 
yet distinct genes. 14-3-3 proteins recognize phosphorylated motifs within 
numerous human and viral proteins. Here, we analyze by X-ray crystallography, 
fluorescence polarization, mutagenesis and fusicoccin-mediated modulation the 
structural basis and druggability of 14-3-3 binding to four E6 oncoproteins of 
tumorigenic human papillomaviruses. 14-3-3 isoforms bind variant and mutated 
phospho-motifs of E6 and unrelated protein RSK1 with different affinities, 
albeit following an ordered affinity ranking with conserved relative KD ratios. 
Remarkably, 14-3-3 isoforms obey the same hierarchy when binding to most of 
their established targets, as supported by literature and a recent human 
complexome map. This knowledge allows predicting proportions of 14-3-3 isoforms 
engaged with phosphoproteins in various tissues. Notwithstanding their 
individual functions, cellular concentrations of 14-3-3 may be collectively 
adjusted to buffer the strongest phosphorylation outbursts, explaining their 
expression variations in different tissues and tumors.

Glycolysis is regulated by numerous mechanisms including allosteric regulation, 
post-translational modification or protein-protein interactions (PPI). While 
glycolytic enzymes have been found to interact with hundreds of proteins, the 
impact of only some of these PPIs on glycolysis is well understood. Here we 
investigate which of these interactions may affect glycolysis in E. coli and 
possibly across numerous other bacteria, based on the stoichiometry of 
interacting protein pairs (from proteomic studies) and their conservation across 
bacteria. We present a list of 339 protein-protein interactions involving 
glycolytic enzymes but predict that ~70% of glycolytic interactors are not 
present in adequate amounts to have a significant impact on glycolysis. Finally, 
we identify a conserved but uncharacterized subset of interactions that are 
likely to affect glycolysis and deserve further study.

In the cytosol of human cells under low oxidative loads, hydrogen peroxide is 
confined to microdomains around its supply sites, due to its fast consumption by 
peroxiredoxins. So are the sulfenic and disulfide forms of the 2-Cys 
peroxiredoxins, according to a previous theoretical analysis [Travasso et al., 
Redox Biology 15 (2017) 297]. Here, an extended reaction-diffusion model that 
for the first time considers the differential properties of human peroxiredoxins 
1 and 2 and the thioredoxin redox cycle predicts important new aspects of the 
dynamics of redox microdomains. The peroxiredoxin 1 sulfenates and disulfides 
are more localized than the corresponding peroxiredoxin 2 forms, due to the 
former peroxiredoxin's faster resolution step. The thioredoxin disulfides are 
also localized. As the H2O2 supply rate (vsup) approaches and then surpasses the 
maximal rate of the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system (V), these 
concentration gradients become shallower, and then vanish. At low vsup the 
peroxiredoxin concentration determines the H2O2 concentrations and gradient 
length scale, but as vsup approaches V, the thioredoxin reductase activity gains 
influence. A differential mobility of peroxiredoxin disulfide dimers vs. reduced 
decamers enhances the redox polarity of the cytosol: as vsup approaches V, 
reduced decamers are preferentially retained far from H2O2 sources, attenuating 
the local H2O2 buildup. Substantial total protein concentration gradients of 
both peroxiredoxins emerge under these conditions, and the concentration of 
reduced peroxiredoxin 1 far from the H2O2 sources even increases with vsup. 
Altogether, the properties of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins and thioredoxin are such that 
localized H2O2 supply induces a redox and functional polarization between 
source-proximal regions (redox microdomains) that facilitate 
peroxiredoxin-mediated signaling and distal regions that maximize antioxidant 
protection.

Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK, encoded by the SYK gene, is a non-receptor type 
protein kinase which mediates immune signal transduction through 
immunoreceptors. Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK expression has been associated with 
the development of various inflammatory diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative 
conditions. The reproducibility of tyrosine-protein kinase SYK research would 
help elucidate the mechanism in which it causes neuroinflammation as well as its 
potential as a novel target to treat Alzheimer's disease. This would be 
facilitated with the availability of high-quality tyrosine-protein kinase SYK. 
In this study, we characterized thirteen tyrosine-protein kinase SYK commercial 
antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a 
standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell 
lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing 
antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the 
most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

Hal3 (Sis2) is a yeast protein that was initially identified as a regulatory 
subunit of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ser/Thr protein phosphatase Ppz1. A few 
years later, it was shown to participate in the formation of an atypical 
heterotrimeric phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPCDC) enzyme, thus 
catalyzing a key reaction in the pathway leading to Coenzyme A biosynthesis. 
Therefore, Hal3 was defined as a moonlighting protein. The structure of Hal3 in 
some fungi is made of a conserved core, similar to bacterial or mammalian 
PPCDCs; meanwhile, in others, the gene encodes a larger protein with N- and 
C-terminal extensions. In this work, we describe how Hal3 (and its close 
relative Cab3) participates in these disparate functions and we review recent 
findings that could make it possible to predict which of these two proteins will 
show moonlighting properties in fungi.

Identification of protein biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis remains 
a critical unmet clinical need. A major reason is that the dynamic relationship 
between proliferating and necrotic cell populations during vascularized tumor 
growth, and the associated extra- and intra-cellular protein outflux from these 
populations into blood circulation remains poorly understood. Complementary to 
experimental efforts, mathematical approaches have been employed to effectively 
simulate the kinetics of detectable surface proteins (e.g., CA-125) shed into 
the bloodstream. However, existing models can be difficult to tune and may be 
unable to capture the dynamics of non-extracellular proteins, such as those shed 
from necrotic and apoptosing cells. The models may also fail to account for 
intra-tumoral spatial and microenvironmental heterogeneity. We present a new 
multi-compartment model to simulate heterogeneously vascularized growing tumors 
and the corresponding protein outflux. Model parameters can be tuned from 
histology data, including relative vascular volume, mean vessel diameter, and 
distance from vasculature to necrotic tissue. The model enables evaluating the 
difference in shedding rates between extra- and non-extracellular proteins from 
viable and necrosing cells as a function of heterogeneous vascularization. 
Simulation results indicate that under certain conditions it is possible for 
non-extracellular proteins to have superior outflux relative to extracellular 
proteins. This work contributes towards the goal of cancer biomarker 
identification by enabling simulation of protein shedding kinetics based on 
tumor tissue-specific characteristics. Ultimately, we anticipate that models 
like the one introduced herein will enable examining origins and circulating 
dynamics of candidate biomarkers, thus facilitating marker selection for 
validation studies.

Model-informed drug discovery is endorsed by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to improve the flow of medicines from bench to bedside. In the case of 
monoclonal antibodies, this necessitates taking into account not only the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the drug, but also the tissue distribution, 
concentration, and turnover of the target to guide dose and affinity selection, 
as well as serve as a link to downstream pharmacology. Relevant information 
(e.g., tissue proteomic data from quantitative mass spectrometry), is 
increasingly available from public domain data repositories, although not 
necessarily in the form that is directly usable for the purpose of quantitative, 
predictive, and mechanistic PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling based on molarity 
or similar frameworks instead. Using secreted plasma protein concentrations 
measured both by immunochemical methods and mass spectrometry, we addressed this 
gap and derived an optimized nonlinear empirical function that establishes the 
correlation between the two data sets and validated the approach taken using a 
wider data set of all proteins found in plasma. In addition, we present a 
semimechanistic framework for the plasma half-life of soluble proteins where 
clearance is expressed as a nonlinear function of the molecular weight of the 
protein. Finally, we apply the approach to two established therapeutic antibody 
targets: complement factor C5 and PCSK9 to demonstrate how the described 
framework can be applied to predictive PK/PD modeling.

The PPP2R2A gene encodes the B55α regulatory subunit of PP2A. Here, we report 
that PPP2R2A is hemizygously lost in ~42% of prostate adenocarcinomas, 
correlating with reduced expression, poorer prognosis, and an increased 
incidence of hemizygous loss (>75%) in metastatic disease. Of note, PPP2R2A 
homozygous loss is less common (5%) and not increased at later tumor stages. 
Reduced expression of B55α is also seen in prostate tumor tissue and cell lines. 
Consistent with the possibility that complete loss of PPP2R2A is detrimental in 
prostate tumors, PPP2R2A deletion in cells with reduced but present B55α reduces 
cell proliferation by slowing progression through the cell cycle. Remarkably, 
B55α-low cells also appear addicted to lower B55α expression, as even moderate 
increases in B55α expression are toxic. Reconstitution of B55α expression in 
prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines with low B55α expression reduces proliferation, 
inhibits transformation and blocks xenograft tumorigenicity. Mechanistically, we 
show B55α reconstitution reduces phosphorylation of proteins essential for 
centrosomal maintenance, and induces centrosome collapse and chromosome 
segregation failure; a first reported link between B55α/PP2A and the vertebrate 
centrosome. These effects are dependent on a prolonged metaphase/anaphase 
checkpoint and are lethal to PCa cells addicted to low levels of B55α. Thus, we 
propose the reduction in B55α levels associated with hemizygous loss is 
necessary for centrosomal integrity in PCa cells, leading to selective lethality 
of B55α reconstitution. Such a vulnerability could be targeted therapeutically 
in the large pool of patients with hemizygous PPP2R2A deletions, using 
pharmacologic approaches that enhance PP2A/B55α activity.

The increasingly large amount of proteomics data in the public domain enables, 
among other applications, the combined analyses of datasets to create 
comparative protein expression maps covering different organisms and different 
biological conditions. Here we have reanalysed public proteomics datasets from 
mouse and rat tissues (14 and 9 datasets, respectively), to assess baseline 
protein abundance. Overall, the aggregated dataset contained 23 individual 
datasets, including a total of 211 samples coming from 34 different tissues 
across 14 organs, comprising 9 mouse and 3 rat strains, respectively. In all 
cases, we studied the distribution of canonical proteins between the different 
organs. The number of canonical proteins per dataset ranged from 273 (tendon) 
and 9,715 (liver) in mouse, and from 101 (tendon) and 6,130 (kidney) in rat. 
Then, we studied how protein abundances compared across different datasets and 
organs for both species. As a key point we carried out a comparative analysis of 
protein expression between mouse, rat and human tissues. We observed a high 
level of correlation of protein expression among orthologs between all three 
species in brain, kidney, heart and liver samples, whereas the correlation of 
protein expression was generally slightly lower between organs within the same 
species. Protein expression results have been integrated into the resource 
Expression Atlas for widespread dissemination.

Plasmodium falciparum is a causative agent of human malaria. Sixty percent of 
mRNAs from its extremely AT-rich (81%) genome harbor long polyadenosine (polyA) 
runs within their ORFs, distinguishing the parasite from its hosts and other 
sequenced organisms. Recent studies indicate polyA runs cause ribosome stalling 
and frameshifting, triggering mRNA surveillance pathways and attenuating protein 
synthesis. Here, we show that P. falciparum is an exception to this rule. We 
demonstrate that both endogenous genes and reporter sequences containing long 
polyA runs are efficiently and accurately translated in P. falciparum cells. We 
show that polyA runs do not elicit any response from No Go Decay (NGD) or result 
in the production of frameshifted proteins. This is in stark contrast to what we 
observe in human cells or T. thermophila, an organism with similar AT-content. 
Finally, using stalling reporters we show that Plasmodium cells evolved not to 
have a fully functional NGD pathway.

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) discriminate nonspecific macromolecules from 
importin and exportin receptors, collectively termed "karyopherins" (Kaps), that 
mediate nucleocytoplasmic transport. This selective barrier function is 
attributed to the behavior of intrinsically disordered phenylalanine-glycine 
nucleoporins (FG Nups) that guard the NPC channel. However, NPCs in vivo are 
typically enriched with different Kaps, and how they impact the NPC barrier 
remains unknown. Here, we show that two major Kaps, importinβ1/karyopherinβ1 
(Kapβ1) and exportin 1/chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), are required to fortify 
NPC barrier function in vivo. Their enrichment at the NPC is sustained by 
promiscuous binding interactions with the FG Nups, which enable CRM1 to 
compensate for the loss of Kapβ1 as a means to maintain NPC barrier function. 
However, such a compensatory mechanism is constrained by the cellular abundances 
and different binding kinetics for each respective Kap, as evidenced for 
importin-5. Consequently, we find that NPC malfunction and nucleocytoplasmic 
leakage result from poor Kap enrichment.

Gene expression is a fundamental process that enables cells to produce specific 
proteins in a timely and spatially dependent manner. In eukaryotic cells, the 
complex organization of the cell body requires precise control of protein 
synthesis and localization. Certain mRNAs encode proteins with an N-terminal 
signal sequences that direct the translation apparatus toward a specific 
organelle. Here, we focus on the mechanisms governing the translation of mRNAs, 
which encode proteins with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal in human cells. 
The binding of a signal-recognition particle (SRP) to the translation machinery 
halts protein synthesis until the mRNA-ribosome complex reaches the ER membrane. 
The commonly accepted model suggests that mRNA that encodes a protein that 
contains an ER signal peptide continuously repeats the cycle of SRP binding 
followed by association and dissociation with the ER. In contrast to the current 
view, we show that the long mRNAs remain on the ER while being translated. On 
the other hand, due to low ribosome occupancy, the short mRNAs continue the 
cycle, always facing a translation pause. Ultimately, this leads to a 
significant drop in the translation efficiency of small, ER-targeted proteins. 
The proposed mechanism advances our understanding of selective protein synthesis 
in eukaryotic cells and provides new avenues to enhance protein production in 
biotechnological settings.

Liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules is increasingly recognized as 
relevant to various cellular functions, and complex coacervation of 
biomacromolecules, particularly proteins, is emerging as a key mechanism for 
this phenomenon. Complex coacervation is also being explored as a potential 
protein purification method due to its potential scalability, aqueous operation, 
and ability to produce a highly concentrated product. However, to date most 
studies of complex coacervation have evaluated the phase behavior of a binary 
mixture of two oppositely charged macromolecules. Therefore, a comprehensive 
understanding of the phase behavior of complex biological mixtures has yet to be 
established. To address this, a panel of engineered proteins was designed to 
allow for quantitative analysis of the complex coacervation of individual 
proteins within a multi-component mixture. The behavior of individual proteins 
was evaluated using a defined mixture of proteins that mimics the charge profile 
of the E. coli proteome. To allow for direct quantification of proteins in each 
phase, spectrally separated fluorescent proteins were used to construct the 
protein mixture. From this quantitative analysis, we observed that the 
coacervation behavior of individual proteins in the mixture was consistent with 
each other, which was distinctive from the behavior when each protein was 
evaluated in a single-protein system. Subtle differences in biophysical 
properties between the proteins became noticeable in the mixture, which allowed 
us to elucidate parameters for protein complex coacervation. With this 
understanding, we successfully designed methods to enrich a range of proteins of 
interest from a mixture of proteins.

extracellular stimulation has been studied using mass spectrometry-based 
proteomics methods. To complement prior work and fully characterize all 
phosphorylated proteins after the stimulation of cell signaling, we developed 
K-BMAPS (kinase-catalyzed biotinylation to map signaling), which utilizes 
ATP-biotin as a kinase cosubstrate to biotin label substrates. As a first 
application of the K-BMAPS method, the well-characterized epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) kinase signaling pathway was monitored by treating 
epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated HeLa lysates with ATP-biotin, followed 
by streptavidin enrichment and quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. On the 
basis of the dynamic phosphoproteins identified, a pathway map was developed 
considering functional categories and known interactors of EGFR. Remarkably, 94% 
of the K-BMAPS hit proteins were included in the EGFR pathway map. With many 
proteins involved in transcription, translation, cell adhesion, and GTPase 
signaling, K-BMAPS identified phosphoproteins were associated with late and 
continuous signaling events. In summary, the K-BMAPS method is a powerful tool 
to map the dynamic phosphorylation governing cell signaling pathways.

While aggregation-prone proteins are known to accelerate aging and cause 
age-related diseases, the cellular mechanisms that drive their cytotoxicity 
remain unresolved. The orthologous proteins MOAG-4, SERF1A, and SERF2 have 
recently been identified as cellular modifiers of such proteotoxicity. Using a 
peptide array screening approach on human amyloidogenic proteins, we found that 
SERF2 interacted with protein segments enriched in negatively charged and 
hydrophobic, aromatic amino acids. The absence of such segments, or 
the neutralization of the positive charge in SERF2, prevented these interactions 
and abolished the amyloid-promoting activity of SERF2. In protein aggregation 
models in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, protein aggregation and 
toxicity were suppressed by mutating the endogenous locus of MOAG-4 to 
neutralize charge. Our data indicate that MOAG-4 and SERF2 drive protein 
aggregation and toxicity by interactions with negatively charged segments in 
aggregation-prone proteins. Such charge interactions might accelerate primary 
nucleation of amyloid by initiating structural changes and by decreasing 
colloidal stability. Our study points at charge interactions between cellular 
modifiers and amyloidogenic proteins as potential targets for interventions to 
reduce age-related protein toxicity.

Termination efficiency of stop codons depends on the first 3' flanking (+4) base 
in bacteria and eukaryotes. In both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, termination read-through is reduced in the presence of +4U; however, 
the molecular mechanism underlying +4U function is poorly understood. Here, we 
perform comparative genomics analysis on 25 bacterial species (covering 
Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, and Spirochaetae) with bioinformatics approaches to examine the 
influence of +4U in bacterial translation termination by contrasting highly- and 
lowly-expressed genes (HEGs and LEGs, respectively). We estimated gene 
expression using the recently formulated Index of Translation Elongation, ITE, 
and identified stop codon near-cognate transfer RNAs (tRNAs) from well-annotated 
genomes. We show that +4U was consistently overrepresented in UAA-ending HEGs 
relative to LEGs. The result is consistent with the interpretation that +4U 
enhances termination mainly for UAA. Usage of +4U decreases in GC-rich species 
where most stop codons are UGA and UAG, with few UAA-ending genes, which is 
expected if UAA usage in HEGs drives up +4U usage. In HEGs, +4U usage increases 
significantly with abundance of UAA nc_tRNAs (near-cognate tRNAs that decode 
codons differing from UAA by a single nucleotide), particularly those with a 
mismatch at the first stop codon site. UAA is always the preferred stop codon in 
HEGs, and our results suggest that UAAU is the most efficient translation 
termination signal in bacteria.

The phosphorylation of 14-3-3 binding motif is involved in many cellular 
processes. A strategy that enables targeted degradation of 14-3-3-binding 
phosphoproteins (14-3-3-BPPs) for studying their functions is highly desirable 
for basic research. Here, we report a phosphorylation-induced, 
ubiquitin-proteasome-system-mediated targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategy 
that allows specific degradation of 14-3-3-BPPs. Specifically, by ligating a 
modified von Hippel-Lindau E3-ligase with an engineered 14-3-3 bait, we 
generated a protein chimera referred to as Targeted Degradation of 
14-3-3-binding PhosphoProtein (TDPP). TDPP can serve as a universal degrader for 
14-3-3-BPPs based on the specific recognition of the phosphorylation in 14-3-3 
binding motifs. TDPP shows high efficiency and specificity to a difopein-EGFP 
reporter, general and specific 14-3-3-BPPs. TDPP can also be applied for the 
validation of 14-3-3-BPPs. These results strongly support TDPP as a powerful 
tool for 14-3-3 related research.

Buffering of genetic dominance by allele-specific protein complex assembly.

Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.

Protein complex assembly often occurs while subunits are being translated, 
resulting in complexes whose subunits were translated from the same mRNA in an 
allele-specific manner. It has thus been hypothesized that such cotranslational 
assembly may counter the assembly-mediated dominant-negative effect, whereby 
co-assembly of mutant and wild-type subunits "poisons" complex activity. Here, 
we show that cotranslationally assembling subunits are much less likely to be 
associated with autosomal dominant relative to recessive disorders, and that 
subunits with dominant-negative disease mutations are significantly depleted in 
cotranslational assembly compared to those associated with loss-of-function 
mutations. We also find that complexes with known dominant-negative effects tend 
to expose their interfaces late during translation, lessening the likelihood of 
cotranslational assembly. Finally, by combining complex properties with other 
features, we trained a computational model for predicting proteins likely to be 
associated with non-loss-of-function disease mechanisms, which we believe will 
be of considerable utility for protein variant interpretation.

Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), a 3' exoribonuclease that degrades RNA in 
the 3'-to-5' direction, is the major mRNA decay activity in Bacillus subtilis. 
PNPase is known to be inhibited in vitro by strong RNA secondary structure, and 
rapid mRNA turnover in vivo is thought to require an RNA helicase activity 
working in conjunction with PNPase. The most abundant RNA helicase in B. 
subtilis is CshA. We found for three small, monocistronic mRNAs that, for some 
RNA sequences, PNPase processivity was unimpeded even without CshA, whereas 
others required CshA for efficient degradation. A novel colour screen for decay 
of mRNA in B. subtilis was created, using mRNA encoded by the slrA gene, which 
is degraded from its 3' end by PNPase. A significant correlation between the 
predicted strength of a stem-loop structure, located in the body of the message, 
and PNPase processivity was observed. Northern blot analysis confirmed that 
PNPase processivity was greatly hindered by the internal RNA structure, and even 
more so in the absence of CshA. Three other B. subtilis RNA helicases did not 
appear to be involved in mRNA decay during vegetative growth. The results 
confirm the hypothesis that efficient 3' exonucleolytic decay of B. subtilis RNA 
depends on the combined activity of PNPase and CshA.

BACKGROUND: Adoptive immunotherapy offers great potential for treating many 
types of cancer but its clinical application is hampered by cross-reactive T 
cell responses in healthy human tissues, representing serious safety risks for 
patients. We previously developed a computational tool called Expitope for 
assessing cross-reactivity (CR) of antigens based on tissue-specific gene 
expression. However, transcript abundance only indirectly indicates protein 
expression. The recent availability of proteome-wide human protein abundance 
information now facilitates a more direct approach for CR prediction. Here we 
present a new version 2.0 of Expitope, which computes all naturally possible 
epitopes of a peptide sequence and the corresponding CR indices using both 
protein and transcript abundance levels weighted by a proposed hierarchy of 
importance of various human tissues.
RESULTS: We tested the tool in two case studies: The first study quantitatively 
assessed the potential CR of the epitopes used for cancer immunotherapy. The 
second study evaluated HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes obtained from the Immune 
Epitope Database for different disease groups and demonstrated for the first 
time that there is a high variation in the background CR depending on the 
disease state of the host: compared to a healthy individual the CR index is on 
average two-fold higher for the autoimmune state, and five-fold higher for the 
cancer state.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability to predict potential side effects in normal tissues 
helps in the development and selection of safer antigens, enabling more 
successful immunotherapy of cancer and other diseases.

p97, also known as valosin-containing protein, is an essential cytosolic AAA+ 
(ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) hexamer that unfolds 
substrate polypeptides to support protein homeostasis and macromolecular 
disassembly. Distinct sets of p97 adaptors guide cellular functions but their 
roles in direct control of the hexamer are unclear. The UBXD1 adaptor localizes 
with p97 in critical mitochondria and lysosome clearance pathways and contains 
multiple p97-interacting domains. Here we identify UBXD1 as a potent p97 ATPase 
inhibitor and report structures of intact human p97-UBXD1 complexes that reveal 
extensive UBXD1 contacts across p97 and an asymmetric remodeling of the hexamer. 
Conserved VIM, UBX and PUB domains tether adjacent protomers while a connecting 
strand forms an N-terminal domain lariat with a helix wedged at the 
interprotomer interface. An additional VIM-connecting helix binds along the 
second (D2) AAA+ domain. Together, these contacts split the hexamer into a 
ring-open conformation. Structures, mutagenesis and comparisons to other 
adaptors further reveal how adaptors containing conserved p97-remodeling motifs 
regulate p97 ATPase activity and structure.

The accurate construction of computational models in systems biology heavily 
relies on the availability of quantitative proteomics data, specifically, 
absolute protein abundances. However, the complex nature of proteomics data 
analysis necessitates specialised expertise, making the integration of this data 
into models challenging. Therefore, the development of software tools that ease 
the analysis of proteomics data and bridge between disciplines is crucial for 
advancing the field of systems biology. We developed an open access Python-based 
software tool available either as downloadable library or as web-based graphical 
user interface (GUI). The pipeline simplifies the extraction and calculation of 
protein abundances from unprocessed proteomics data, accommodating a range of 
experimental approaches based on label-free quantification. Our tool was 
conceived as a versatile and robust pipeline designed to ease and simplify data 
analysis, thereby improving reproducibility between researchers and 
institutions. Moreover, the robust modular structure of Alpaca allows its 
integration with other software tools.

BACKGROUND: Accurate non-invasive prediction of long-term hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) risk in advanced liver fibrosis is urgently needed for 
cost-effective HCC screening; however, this currently remains an unmet need.
METHODS: A serum-protein-based prognostic liver secretome signature (PLSec) was 
bioinformatically derived from previously validated hepatic transcriptome 
signatures and optimized in 79 patients with advanced liver fibrosis. We 
independently validated PLSec for HCC risk in 331 cirrhosis patients with mixed 
etiologies (validation set 1 [V1]) and thereafter developed a score with 
clinical prognostic variables. The score was then validated in two independent 
cohorts: validation set 2 (V2): 164 patients with advanced liver fibrosis due to 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection cured after direct-acting antiviral therapy; 
validation set 3 (V3): 146 patients with advanced liver fibrosis with 
successfully-treated HCC and cured HCV infection.
FINDINGS: An 8-protein blood-based PLSec recapitulated transcriptome-based 
hepatic HCC risk status. In V1, PLSec was significantly associated with incident 
HCC risk (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.30-4.23). A composite score with serum alpha-fetoprotein (PLSec-AFP) was 
defined in V1, and validated in V2 (adjusted odds ratio, 3.80 [95%CI, 
1.66-8.66]) and V3 (aHR, 3.08 [95%CI, 1.78-5.31]; c-index, 0.74). PLSec-AFP 
outperformed AFP alone (Brier score, 0.165 vs. 0.186 in V2; 0.196 vs. 0.206 in 
V3, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The blood-based PLSec-AFP can accurately stratify patients with 
advanced liver fibrosis for long-term HCC risk and thereby guide risk-based 
tailored HCC screening.

Metabolic efficiency profoundly influences organismal fitness. Nonphotosynthetic 
organisms, from yeast to mammals, derive usable energy primarily through 
glycolysis and respiration. Although respiration is more energy efficient, some 
cells favor glycolysis even when oxygen is available (aerobic glycolysis, 
Warburg effect). A leading explanation is that glycolysis is more efficient in 
terms of ATP production per unit mass of protein (that is, faster). Through 
quantitative flux analysis and proteomics, we find, however, that mitochondrial 
respiration is actually more proteome efficient than aerobic glycolysis. This is 
shown across yeast strains, T cells, cancer cells, and tissues and tumors in 
vivo. Instead of aerobic glycolysis being valuable for fast ATP production, it 
correlates with high glycolytic protein expression, which promotes hypoxic 
growth. Aerobic glycolytic yeasts do not excel at aerobic growth but outgrow 
respiratory cells during oxygen limitation. We accordingly propose that aerobic 
glycolysis emerges from cells maintaining a proteome conducive to both aerobic 
and hypoxic growth.

eIF2A was the first eukaryotic initiator tRNA carrier discovered but its exact 
function has remained enigmatic. Uncharacteristic of translation initiation 
factors, eIF2A is reported to be non-cytosolic in multiple human cancer cell 
lines. Attempts to study eIF2A mechanistically have been limited by the 
inability to achieve high yield of soluble recombinant protein. Here, we 
developed a purification paradigm that yields ∼360-fold and ∼6000-fold more 
recombinant human eIF2A from Escherichia coli and insect cells, respectively, 
than previous reports. Using a mammalian in vitro translation system, we found 
that increased levels of recombinant human eIF2A inhibit translation of multiple 
reporter mRNAs, including those that are translated by cognate and near-cognate 
start codons, and does so prior to start codon recognition. eIF2A also inhibited 
translation directed by all four types of cap-independent viral IRESs, including 
the CrPV IGR IRES that does not require initiation factors or initiator tRNA, 
suggesting excess eIF2A sequesters 40S subunits. Supplementation with additional 
40S subunits prevented eIF2A-mediated inhibition and pull-down assays 
demonstrated direct binding between recombinant eIF2A and purified 40S subunits. 
These data support a model that eIF2A must be kept away from the translation 
machinery to avoid sequestering 40S ribosomal subunits.

GeneCards is a one-stop shop for searchable human gene annotations 
(http://www.genecards.org/). Data are automatically mined from ∼120 sources and 
presented in an integrated web card for every human gene. We report the 
application of recent advances in proteomics to enhance gene annotation and 
classification in GeneCards. First, we constructed the Human Integrated Protein 
Expression Database (HIPED), a unified database of protein abundance in human 
tissues, based on the publically available mass spectrometry (MS)-based 
proteomics sources ProteomicsDB, Multi-Omics Profiling Expression Database, 
Protein Abundance Across Organisms and The MaxQuant DataBase. The integrated 
database, residing within GeneCards, compares favourably with its individual 
sources, covering nearly 90% of human protein-coding genes. For gene annotation 
and comparisons, we first defined a protein expression vector for each gene, 
based on normalized abundances in 69 normal human tissues. This vector is 
portrayed in the GeneCards expression section as a bar graph, allowing visual 
inspection and comparison. These data are juxtaposed with transcriptome bar 
graphs. Using the protein expression vectors, we further defined a pairwise 
metric that helps assess expression-based pairwise proximity. This new metric 
for finding functional partners complements eight others, including sharing of 
pathways, gene ontology (GO) terms and domains, implemented in the GeneCards 
Suite. In parallel, we calculated proteome-based differential expression, 
highlighting a subset of tissues that overexpress a gene and subserving gene 
classification. This textual annotation allows users of VarElect, the suite's 
next-generation phenotyper, to more effectively discover causative disease 
variants. Finally, we define the protein-RNA expression ratio and correlation as 
yet another attribute of every gene in each tissue, adding further annotative 
information. The results constitute a significant enhancement of several 
GeneCards sections and help promote and organize the genome-wide structural and 
functional knowledge of the human proteome. Database

The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution is considered the most powerful theory 
to understand the evolutionary behavior of proteins. One of the main predictions 
of this theory is that essential proteins should evolve slower than dispensable 
ones owing to increased selective constraints. Comparison of genomes of 
different species, however, has revealed only small differences between the 
rates of evolution of essential and nonessential proteins. In some analyses, 
these differences vanish once confounding factors are controlled for, whereas in 
other cases essentiality seems to have an independent, albeit small, effect. It 
has been argued that comparing relatively distant genomes may entail a number of 
limitations. For instance, many of the genes that are dispensable in controlled 
lab conditions may be essential in some of the conditions faced in nature. 
Moreover, essentiality can change during evolution, and rates of protein 
evolution are simultaneously shaped by a variety of factors, whose individual 
effects are difficult to isolate. Here, we conducted two parallel mutation 
accumulation experiments in Escherichia coli, during 5,500-5,750 generations, 
and compared the genomes at different points of the experiments. Our approach (a 
short-term experiment, under highly controlled conditions) enabled us to 
overcome many of the limitations of previous studies. We observed that essential 
proteins evolved substantially slower than nonessential ones during our 
experiments. Strikingly, rates of protein evolution were only moderately 
affected by expression level and protein length.

Eukaryotic proteins consist of structural domains (SDs) and intrinsically 
disordered regions (IDRs), i.e., regions that by themselves do not assume unique 
three-dimensional structures. IDRs are generally subject to less constraint and 
evolve more rapidly than SDs. Proteins with a lower number of protein-to-protein 
interactions (PPIs) are also less constrained and tend to evolve fast. 
Extracellular proteins of mammals, especially immune-related extracellular 
proteins, on average have relatively high evolution rates. This article aims to 
examine if a high evolution rate in IDRs or that in SDs accounts for the rapid 
evolution of extracellular proteins. To this end, we classified eukaryotic 
proteins based on their cellular localizations and analyzed them. Moreover, we 
divided proteins into SDs and IDRs and calculated the respective evolution rate. 
Fractional IDR content is positively correlated with evolution rate. For their 
fractional IDR content, immune-related extracellular proteins show an aberrantly 
high evolution rate. IDRs evolve more rapidly than SDs in most subcellular 
localizations. In extracellular proteins, however, the difference is diminished. 
For immune-related proteins in mammals in particular, the evolution rates in SDs 
come close to those in IDRs. Thus high evolution rates in both IDRs and SDs 
account for the rapid evolution of immune-related proteins.

Efficient control over multiple gene expression still presents a major 
challenge. Synthetic sRNA enables targeted gene expression control in trans 
without directly modifying the chromosome, but its use to simultaneously target 
multiple genes can often cause cell growth defects because of the need for 
additional energy for transcription and lowering of their repression efficiency 
by limiting the amount of Hfq protein. To address these limitations, we present 
fusion sRNA (fsRNA) that simultaneously regulates the translation of multiple 
genes efficiently. It is constructed by linking the mRNA-binding modules for 
multiple targeted genes in one sRNA scaffold via one-pot generation using 
overlap extension PCR. The repression capacity of fsRNA was demonstrated by the 
construction of sRNAs to target four endogenous genes: caiF, hybG, ytfR and minD 
in Escherichia coli. Their cross-reactivity and the effect on cell growth were 
also investigated. As practical applications, we applied fsRNA to violacein- and 
protocatechuic acid-producing strains, resulting in increases of 13% violacein 
and 81% protocatechuic acid, respectively. The developed fsRNA-mediated multiple 
gene expression regulation system thus enables rapid and efficient development 
of optimised cell factories for valuable chemicals without cell growth defects 
and limiting cellular resources.Key points• Synthetic fusion sRNA (fsRNA)-based 
system was constructed for the repression of multiple target genes.• fsRNA 
repressed multiple genes by only expressing a single sRNA while minimising the 
cellular burden.• The application of fsRNA showed the increased production 
titers of violacein (13%) and protocatechuic acid (81%).

Effective organization of proteins into functional modules (networks, pathways) 
requires systems-level coordination between transcription, translation and 
degradation. Whereas the cooperation between transcription and translation was 
extensively studied, the cooperative degradation regulation of protein complexes 
and pathways has not been systematically assessed. Here we comprehensively 
analyzed degron masking, a major mechanism by which cellular systems coordinate 
degron recognition and protein degradation. For over 200 substrates with 
characterized degrons (E3 ligase targeting motifs, ubiquitination sites and 
disordered proteasomal entry sequences), we demonstrate that degrons extensively 
overlap with protein-protein interaction sites. Analysis of binding site 
information and protein abundance comparisons show that regulatory partners 
effectively outcompete E3 ligases, masking degrons from the ubiquitination 
machinery. Protein abundance variations between normal and cancer cells 
highlight the dynamics of degron masking components. Finally, integrative 
analysis of gene co-expression, half-life correlations and functional 
relationships between interacting proteins point towards higher-order, 
co-regulated degradation modules ('degronons') in the proteome.

Co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) has emerged as a powerful technique 
for interactome mapping. However, there is little consensus on optimal 
strategies for the design of CF-MS experiments or their computational analysis. 
Here, we reanalyzed a total of 206 CF-MS experiments to generate a uniformly 
processed resource containing over 11 million measurements of protein abundance. 
We used this resource to benchmark experimental designs for CF-MS studies and 
systematically optimize computational approaches to network inference. We then 
applied this optimized methodology to reconstruct a draft-quality human 
interactome by CF-MS and predict over 700,000 protein-protein interactions 
across 27 eukaryotic species or clades. Our work defines new resources to 
illuminate proteome organization over evolutionary timescales and establishes 
best practices for the design and analysis of CF-MS studies.

Understanding intracellular phase separation is crucial for deciphering 
transcriptional control, cell fate transitions, and disease mechanisms. However, 
the key residues, which impact phase separation the most for protein phase 
separation function have remained elusive. We develop PSPHunter, which can 
precisely predict these key residues based on machine learning scheme. In vivo 
and in vitro validations demonstrate that truncating just 6 key residues in 
GATA3 disrupts phase separation, enhancing tumor cell migration and inhibiting 
growth. Glycine and its motifs are enriched in spacer and key residues, as 
revealed by our comprehensive analysis. PSPHunter identifies nearly 80% of 
disease-associated phase-separating proteins, with frequent mutated pathological 
residues like glycine and proline often residing in these key residues. 
PSPHunter thus emerges as a crucial tool to uncover key residues, facilitating 
insights into phase separation mechanisms governing transcriptional control, 
cell fate transitions, and disease development.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key signaling agent. Its best characterized 
signaling actions in mammalian cells involve the early oxidation of thiols in 
cytoplasmic phosphatases, kinases and transcription factors. However, these 
redox targets are orders of magnitude less H2O2-reactive and abundant than 
cytoplasmic peroxiredoxins. How can they be oxidized in a signaling time frame? 
Here we investigate this question using computational reaction-diffusion models 
of H2O2 signaling. The results show that at H2O2 supply rates commensurate with 
mitogenic signaling a H2O2 concentration gradient with a length scale of a few 
tenths of μm is established. Even near the supply sites H2O2 concentrations are 
far too low to oxidize typical targets in an early mitogenic signaling time 
frame. Furthermore, any inhibition of the peroxiredoxin or increase in H2O2 
supply able to drastically increase the local H2O2 concentration would collapse 
the concentration gradient and/or cause an extensive oxidation of the 
peroxiredoxins I and II, inconsistent with experimental observations. In turn, 
the local concentrations of peroxiredoxin sulfenate and disulfide forms exceed 
those of H2O2 by several orders of magnitude. Redox targets reacting with these 
forms at rate constants much lower than that for, say, thioredoxin could be 
oxidized within seconds. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the 
concentrations of these peroxiredoxin forms allows them to reach targets within 
1 μm from the H2O2 sites while maintaining signaling localized. The recruitment 
of peroxiredoxins to specific sites such as caveolae can dramatically increase 
the local concentrations of the sulfenic and disulfide forms, thus further 
helping these species to outcompete H2O2 for the oxidation of redox targets. 
Altogether, these results suggest that H2O2 signaling is mediated by localized 
redox relays whereby peroxiredoxins are oxidized to sulfenate and disulfide 
forms at H2O2 supply sites and these forms in turn oxidize the redox targets 
near these sites.

The ribosome is a complex molecular machine composed of numerous distinct 
proteins and nucleic acids and is responsible for protein synthesis in every 
living cell. Ribosome biogenesis is one of the most multifaceted and energy- 
demanding processes in biology, involving a large number of assembly and 
maturation factors, the functions of which are orchestrated by multiple cellular 
inputs, including mitogenic signals and nutrient availability. Although causal 
associations between inherited mutations affecting ribosome biogenesis and 
elevated cancer risk have been established over the past decade, mechanistic 
data have emerged suggesting a broader role for dysregulated ribosome biogenesis 
in the development and progression of most spontaneous cancers. In this Opinion 
article, we highlight the most recent findings that provide new insights into 
the molecular basis of ribosome biogenesis in cancer and offer our perspective 
on how these observations present opportunities for the design of new targeted 
cancer treatments.

Disordered proteins and domains are ubiquitous throughout the proteome of human 
cell types, yet the biomolecular sciences lack effective tool compounds and 
chemical strategies to study this class of proteins. In this context, we 
introduce a novel covalent tool compound approach that combines 
proximity-enhanced crosslinking with histidine trapping. Utilizing a 
maleimide-cyclohexenone crosslinker for efficient cysteine-histidine 
crosslinking, we elucidated the mechanism of this dual-reactive tool compound 
class. This tool compound concept was then applied to profile the full-length 
complex of 14-3-3 and hyperphosphorylated Tau (hpTau), relevant to Alzheimer's. 
This approach identified a cryptic binding interaction between 14-3-3 and hpTau 
via its phosphorylated Ser356, overlooked by the majority of 14-3-3/Tau 
literature. Utilizing a mutational study and an equilibrium model, this cryptic 
binding interaction is revealed to play a prominent biomolecular role at 
cellularly relevant concentrations. This finding necessitates a re-evaluation of 
the mechanism of the 14-3-3/Tau interaction. The histidine-trap crosslinker 
approach reported here not only advances our understanding of the 14-3-3/Tau 
interaction but also demonstrates the potential of dual-covalent tool compounds 
in studying complex interactions involving IDPs and IDDs.

A target identification platform derived from the bioorthogonal activation of 
reactive species is described. We explore the reactivity of halogenated enamine 
N-oxides and report that the previously undisclosed α,γ-halogenated enamine 
N-oxides can be reduced biooorthogonally by diboron reagents to produce highly 
electrophilic α,β-unsaturated haloiminium ions suitable for labeling a range of 
amino acid residues on proteins in a 1,2- or 1,4-fashion. Affinity labeling 
reagents bearing this motif enable ligand-directed protein modification and 
afford highly sensitive and selective target identification in unbiased 
chemoproteomics experiments. Target identification is supported in both cell 
lysate and live cells.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid 
protein is the most abundantly expressed viral protein during infection where it 
targets both RNA and host proteins. However, identifying how a single viral 
protein interacts with so many different targets remains a challenge, providing 
the impetus here for identifying the interaction sites through multiple methods. 
Through a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron microscopy, 
and biochemical methods, we have characterized nucleocapsid interactions with 
RNA and with three host proteins, which include human cyclophilin-A, Pin1, and 
14-3-3τ. Regarding RNA interactions, the nucleocapsid protein N-terminal folded 
domain preferentially interacts with smaller RNA fragments relative to the 
C-terminal region, suggesting an initial RNA engagement is largely dictated by 
this N-terminal region followed by weaker interactions to the C-terminal region. 
The nucleocapsid protein forms 10 nm ribonuclear complexes with larger RNA 
fragments that include 200 and 354 nucleic acids, revealing its potential 
diversity in sequestering different viral genomic regions during viral 
packaging. Regarding host protein interactions, while the nucleocapsid targets 
all three host proteins through its serine-arginine-rich region, unstructured 
termini of the nucleocapsid protein also engage host cyclophilin-A and host 
14-3-3τ. Considering these host proteins play roles in innate immunity, the 
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein may block the host response by competing 
interactions. Finally, phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein quenches an 
inherent dynamic exchange process within its serine-arginine-rich region. Our 
studies identify many of the diverse interactions that may be important for 
SARS-CoV-2 pathology during infection.

Characterizing shared patterns of RNA expression between genes across conditions 
has led to the discovery of regulatory networks and novel biological functions. 
However, it is unclear if such coordination extends to translation. Here, we 
uniformly analyzed 3,819 ribosome profiling datasets from 117 human and 94 mouse 
tissues and cell lines. We introduce the concept of translation efficiency 
covariation (TEC), identifying coordinated translation patterns across cell 
types. We nominate candidate mechanisms driving shared patterns of translation 
regulation. TEC is conserved across human and mouse cells and uncovers gene 
functions that are not evident from RNA or protein co-expression. Moreover, our 
observations indicate that proteins that physically interact are highly enriched 
for positive covariation at both translational and transcriptional levels. Our 
findings establish TEC as a conserved organizing principle of mammalian 
transcriptomes.

The formation and accumulation of amyloid fibrils is implicated as one of the 
main reasons for the onset and progression of several widespread 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. 
Decades of effort to unravel the intricate mechanisms of amyloid aggregation 
have only led to limited success in developing potent treatment modalities. 
Generally, this failure is considered to be the result of our incomplete 
understanding of the processes governing protein transitions into these 
insoluble fibrillar structures. Recently, a growing number of studies have 
reported that multiple amyloidogenic proteins, including ones related to the 
most debilitating disorders, can cross-interact during aggregation. This process 
leads to different nucleation and fibril elongation rates, aggregate structures, 
and even their cytotoxicity. Despite this revelation, the entire amyloid 
interactome remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the 
cross-interaction between the Alzheimer's disease-related Tau protein and a 
pro-inflammatory S100A9 protein, which has recently been implicated as a 
possible modulator of amyloid aggregation. We show that Tau 2N4R enhances the 
amyloid aggregation propensity of S100A9 and mediates the self-association of 
the resulting fibrils, demonstrating this pairing's potential role in the onset 
of neurodegenerative disorders.

In late 2019, a virus subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and led to a worldwide pandemic of 
the disease termed coronavirus disease 2019. The global health threat posed by 
this pandemic led to an extremely rapid and robust mobilization of the 
scientific and medical communities as evidenced by the publication of more than 
10,000 peer-reviewed articles and thousands of preprints in the first year of 
the pandemic alone. With the publication of the initial genome sequence of 
SARS-CoV-2, the proteomics community immediately joined this effort publishing, 
to date, more than 100 peer-reviewed proteomics studies and submitting many more 
preprints to preprint servers. In this review, we focus on peer-reviewed 
articles published on the proteome, glycoproteome, and glycome of SARS-CoV-2. At 
a basic level, proteomic studies provide valuable information on quantitative 
aspects of viral infection course; information on the identities, sites, and 
microheterogeneity of post-translational modifications; and, information on 
protein-protein interactions. At a biological systems level, these studies 
elucidate host cell and tissue responses, characterize antibodies and other 
immune system factors in infection, suggest biomarkers that may be useful for 
diagnosis and disease-course monitoring, and help in the development or 
repurposing of potential therapeutics. Here, we summarize results from selected 
early studies to provide a perspective on the current rapidly evolving 
literature.

Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen that causes Legionnaire's 
disease in humans. This bacterium can be found in freshwater environments as a 
free-living organism, but it is also an intracellular parasite of protozoa. 
Human infection occurs when inhaled aerosolized pathogen comes into contact with 
the alveolar mucosa and replicates in alveolar macrophages. Legionella enters 
the host cell by phagocytosis and redirects the Legionella-containing phagosomes 
from the phagocytic maturation pathway. These nascent phagosomes fuse with 
ER-derived secretory vesicles and membranes forming the Legionella-containing 
vacuole. Legionella subverts many host cellular processes by secreting over 300 
effector proteins into the host cell via the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. 
The cellular function for many Dot/Icm effectors is still unknown. Here, we 
present a structural and functional study of L. pneumophila effector RavA 
(Lpg0008). Structural analysis revealed that the RavA consists of four ~85 
residue long α-helical domains with similar folds, which show only a low level 
of structural similarity to other protein domains. The ~90 residues long 
C-terminal segment is predicted to be natively unfolded. We show that during L. 
pneumophila infection of human cells, RavA localizes to the Golgi apparatus and 
to the plasma membrane. The same localization is observed when RavA is expressed 
in human cells. The localization signal resides within the C-terminal sequence 
C409 WTSFCGLF417 . Yeast-two-hybrid screen using RavA as bait identified RAB11A 
as a potential binding partner. RavA is present in L. pneumophila strains but 
only distant homologs are found in other Legionella species, where the number of 
repeats varies.

The simple light isotope metabolic-labeling technique relies on the in vivo 
biosynthesis of amino acids from U-[12C]-labeled molecules provided as the sole 
carbon source. The incorporation of the resulting U-[12C]-amino acids into 
proteins presents several key advantages for mass-spectrometry-based proteomics 
analysis, as it results in more intense monoisotopic ions, with a better 
signal-to-noise ratio in bottom-up analysis. In our initial studies, we 
developed the simple light isotope metabolic (SLIM)-labeling strategy using 
prototrophic eukaryotic microorganisms, the yeasts Candida albicans and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as strains with genetic markers that lead to 
amino-acid auxotrophy. To extend the range of SLIM-labeling applications, we 
evaluated (i) the incorporation of U-[12C]-glucose into proteins of human cells 
grown in a complex RPMI-based medium containing the labeled molecule, 
considering that human cell lines require a large number of essential 
amino-acids to support their growth, and (ii) an indirect labeling strategy in 
which the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans grown on plates was fed 
U-[12C]-labeled bacteria (Escherichia coli) and the worm proteome analyzed for 
12C incorporation into proteins. In both cases, we were able to demonstrate 
efficient incorporation of 12C into the newly synthesized proteins, opening the 
way for original approaches in quantitative proteomics.

Dynein adaptor proteins such as Bicaudal D2 (BicD2) are integral components of 
the dynein transport machinery, as they recognize cargoes for cell 
cycle-specific transport and link them to the motor complex. Human BicD2 
switches from selecting secretory and Golgi-derived vesicles for transport in G1 
and S phase (by recognizing Rab6GTP), to selecting the nucleus for transport in 
G2 phase (by recognizing nuclear pore protein Nup358), but the molecular 
mechanisms governing this switch are elusive. Here, we have developed a 
quantitative model for BicD2/cargo interactions that integrates affinities, 
oligomeric states, and cellular concentrations of the reactants. BicD2 and cargo 
form predominantly 2:2 complexes. Furthermore, the affinity of BicD2 toward its 
cargo Nup358 is higher than that toward Rab6GTP. Based on our calculations, an 
estimated 1000 BicD2 molecules per cell would be recruited to the nucleus 
through Nup358 in the absence of regulation. Notably, RanGTP is a negative 
regulator of the Nup358/BicD2 interaction that weakens the affinity by a factor 
of 10 and may play a role in averting dynein recruitment to the nucleus outside 
of the G2 phase. However, our quantitative model predicts that an additional 
negative regulator remains to be identified. In the absence of negative 
regulation, the affinity of Nup358 would likely be sufficient to recruit BicD2 
to the nucleus in G2 phase. Our quantitative model makes testable predictions of 
how cellular transport events are orchestrated. These transport processes are 
important for brain development, cell cycle control, signaling, and 
neurotransmission at synapses.

The expression of proteins in Escherichia coli is often essential for their 
characterization, modification, and subsequent application. Gene sequence is the 
major factor contributing expression. In this study, we used the expression data 
from 6438 heterologous proteins under the same expression condition in E. coli 
to construct a deep learning classifier for screening high- and low-expression 
proteins. In conjunction with conserved residue analysis to minimize functional 
disruption, a mutation predictor for enhanced protein expression (MPEPE) was 
proposed to identify mutations conducive to protein expression. MPEPE identified 
mutation sites in laccase 13B22 and the glucose dehydrogenase FAD-AtGDH, that 
significantly increased both expression levels and activity of these proteins. 
Additionally, a significant correlation of 0.46 between the predicted high level 
expression propensity with the constructed models and the protein abundance of 
endogenous genes in E. coli was also been detected. Therefore, the study 
provides foundational insights into the relationship between specific amino acid 
usage, codon usage, and protein expression, and is essential for research and 
industrial applications.

Disulfide bridges establish a fundamental element in the molecular architecture 
of proteins and peptides which are involved e.g., in basic biological processes 
or acting as toxins. NMR spectroscopy is one method to characterize the 
structure of bioactive compounds including cystine-containing molecules. 
Although the disulfide bridge itself is invisible in NMR, constraints obtained 
via the neighboring NMR-active nuclei allow to define the underlying 
conformation and thereby to resolve their functional background. In this 
mini-review we present shortly the impact of cysteine and disulfide bonds in the 
proteasome from different domains of life and give a condensed overview of 
recent NMR applications for the characterization of disulfide-bond containing 
biomolecules including advantages and limitations of the different approaches.

Revolutionary breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
(ML) have had a profound impact on a wide range of scientific disciplines, 
including the development of artificial cell factories for biomanufacturing. In 
this paper, we review the latest studies on the application of data-driven 
methods for the design of new proteins, pathways, and strains. We first briefly 
introduce the various types of data and databases relevant to industrial 
biomanufacturing, which are the basis for data-driven research. Different types 
of algorithms, including traditional ML and more recent deep learning methods, 
are also presented. We then demonstrate how these data-based approaches can be 
applied to address various issues in cell factory development using examples 
from recent studies, including the prediction of protein function, improvement 
of metabolic models, and estimation of missing kinetic parameters, design of 
non-natural biosynthesis pathways, and pathway optimization. In the last 
section, we discuss the current limitations of these data-driven approaches and 
propose that data-driven methods should be integrated with mechanistic models to 
complement each other and facilitate the development of synthetic strains for 
industrial biomanufacturing.

Readthrough Errors Purge Deleterious Cryptic Sequences, Facilitating the Birth 
of Coding Sequences.

De novo protein-coding innovations sometimes emerge from ancestrally noncoding 
DNA, despite the expectation that translating random sequences is overwhelmingly 
likely to be deleterious. The "preadapting selection" hypothesis claims that 
emergence is facilitated by prior, low-level translation of noncoding sequences 
via molecular errors. It predicts that selection on polypeptides translated only 
in error is strong enough to matter and is strongest when erroneous expression 
is high. To test this hypothesis, we examined noncoding sequences located 
downstream of stop codons (i.e., those potentially translated by readthrough 
errors) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes. We identified a class of "fragile" 
proteins under strong selection to reduce readthrough, which are unlikely 
substrates for co-option. Among the remainder, sequences showing evidence of 
readthrough translation, as assessed by ribosome profiling, encoded C-terminal 
extensions with higher intrinsic structural disorder, supporting the preadapting 
selection hypothesis. The cryptic sequences beyond the stop codon, rather than 
spillover effects from the regular C-termini, are primarily responsible for the 
higher disorder. Results are robust to controlling for the fact that stronger 
selection also reduces the length of C-terminal extensions. These findings 
indicate that selection acts on 3' UTRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to purge 
potentially deleterious variants of cryptic polypeptides, acting more strongly 
in genes that experience more readthrough errors.

The way is the goal: how SecA transports proteins across the cytoplasmic 
membrane in bacteria.

In bacteria, translocation of most soluble secreted proteins (and outer membrane 
proteins in Gram-negative bacteria) across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec 
machinery is mediated by the essential ATPase SecA. At its core, this machinery 
consists of SecA and the integral membrane proteins SecYEG, which form a protein 
conducting channel in the membrane. Proteins are recognised by the Sec machinery 
by virtue of an internally encoded targeting signal, which usually takes the 
form of an N-terminal signal sequence. In addition, substrate proteins must be 
maintained in an unfolded conformation in the cytoplasm, prior to translocation, 
in order to be competent for translocation through SecYEG. Recognition of 
substrate proteins occurs via SecA-either through direct recognition by SecA or 
through secondary recognition by a molecular chaperone that delivers proteins to 
SecA. Substrate proteins are then screened for the presence of a functional 
signal sequence by SecYEG. Proteins with functional signal sequences are 
translocated across the membrane in an ATP-dependent fashion. The current 
research investigating each of these steps is reviewed here.

Pathogenic missense protein variants affect different functional pathways and 
proteomic features than healthy population variants.

Missense variants are present amongst the healthy population, but some of them 
are causative of human diseases. A classification of variants associated with 
"healthy" or "diseased" states is therefore not always straightforward. A deeper 
understanding of the nature of missense variants in health and disease, the 
cellular processes they may affect, and the general molecular principles which 
underlie these differences is essential to offer mechanistic explanations of the 
true impact of pathogenic variants. Here, we have formalised a statistical 
framework which enables robust probabilistic quantification of variant 
enrichment across full-length proteins, their domains, and 3D structure-defined 
regions. Using this framework, we validate and extend previously reported trends 
of variant enrichment in different protein structural regions 
(surface/core/interface). By examining the association of variant enrichment 
with available functional pathways and transcriptomic and proteomic (protein 
half-life, thermal stability, abundance) data, we have mined a rich set of 
molecular features which distinguish between pathogenic and population variants: 
Pathogenic variants mainly affect proteins involved in cell proliferation and 
nucleotide processing and are enriched in more abundant proteins. Additionally, 
rare population variants display features closer to common than pathogenic 
variants. We validate the association between these molecular features and 
variant pathogenicity by comparing against existing in silico variant impact 
annotations. This study provides molecular details into how different proteins 
exhibit resilience and/or sensitivity towards missense variants and provides the 
rationale to prioritise variant-enriched proteins and protein domains for 
therapeutic targeting and development. The ZoomVar database, which we created 
for this study, is available at fraternalilab.kcl.ac.uk/ZoomVar. It allows users 
to programmatically annotate missense variants with protein structural 
information and to calculate variant enrichment in different protein structural 
regions.

INTRODUCTION: The creation of ProteomeXchange data workflows in 2012 transformed 
the field of proteomics, consisting of the standardization of data submission 
and dissemination and enabling the widespread reanalysis of public MS proteomics 
data worldwide. ProteomeXchange has triggered a growing trend toward public 
dissemination of proteomics data, facilitating the assessment, reuse, 
comparative analyses, and extraction of new findings from public datasets. By 
2022, the consortium is integrated by PRIDE, PeptideAtlas, MassIVE, jPOST, 
iProX, and Panorama Public.
AREAS COVERED: Here, we review and discuss the current ecosystem of resources, 
guidelines, and file formats for proteomics data dissemination and reanalysis. 
Special attention is drawn to new exciting quantitative and post-translational 
modification-oriented resources. The challenges and future directions on data 
depositions including the lack of metadata and cloud-based and high-performance 
software solutions for fast and reproducible reanalysis of the available data 
are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: The success of ProteomeXchange and the amount of proteomics data 
available in the public domain have triggered the creation and/or growth of 
other protein knowledgebase resources. Data reuse is a leading, active, and 
evolving field; supporting the creation of new formats, tools, and workflows to 
rediscover and reshape the public proteomics data.

During initiation, the ribosome is tasked to efficiently recognize open reading 
frames (ORFs) for accurate and fast translation of mRNAs. A critical step is 
start codon recognition, which is modulated by initiation factors, mRNA 
structure, a Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence and the start codon itself. Within the 
Escherichia coli genome, we identified more than 50 annotated initiation sites 
harboring AUGUG or GUGUG sequence motifs that provide two canonical start 
codons, AUG and GUG, in immediate proximity. As these sites may challenge start 
codon recognition, we studied if and how the ribosome is accurately guided to 
the designated ORF, with a special focus on the SD sequence as well as adenine 
at the fourth coding sequence position (A4). By in vitro and in vivo 
experiments, we characterized key requirements for unambiguous start codon 
recognition, but also discovered initiation sites that lead to the translation 
of both overlapping reading frames. Our findings corroborate the existence of an 
ambiguous translation initiation mechanism, implicating a multitude of so far 
unrecognized ORFs and translation products in bacteria.

During aging, the cellular response to unfolded proteins is believed to decline, 
resulting in diminished proteostasis. In model organisms, such as Caenorhabditis 
elegans, proteostatic decline with age has been linked to proteome solubility 
shifts and the onset of protein aggregation. However, this correlation has not 
been extensively characterized in aging mammals. To uncover age-dependent 
changes in the insoluble portion of a mammalian proteome, we analyzed the 
detergent-insoluble fraction of mouse brain tissue by mass spectrometry. We 
identified a group of 171 proteins, including the small heat shock protein 
α-crystallin, that become enriched in the detergent-insoluble fraction obtained 
from old mice. To enhance our ability to detect features associated with 
proteins in that fraction, we complemented our data with a meta-analysis of 
studies reporting the detergent-insoluble proteins in various mouse models of 
aging and neurodegeneration. Strikingly, insoluble proteins from young and old 
mice are distinct in several features in our study and across the collected 
literature data. In younger mice, proteins are more likely to be disordered, 
part of membraneless organelles, and involved in RNA binding. These traits 
become less prominent with age, as an increased number of structured proteins 
enter the pellet fraction. This analysis suggests that age-related changes to 
proteome organization lead a group of proteins with specific features to become 
detergent-insoluble. Importantly, these features are not consistent with those 
associated with proteins driving membraneless organelle formation. We see no 
evidence in our system of a general increase of condensate proteins in the 
detergent-insoluble fraction with age.

Nearly all biological processes rely on the finely tuned coordination of protein 
interactions across cellular space and time. Accordingly, generating protein 
interactomes has become routine in biological studies, yet interpreting these 
datasets remains computationally challenging. Here, we introduce Inter-ViSTA 
(Interaction Visualization in Space and Time Analysis), a web-based platform 
that quickly builds animated protein interaction networks and automatically 
synthesizes information on protein abundances, functions, complexes, and 
subcellular localizations. Using Inter-ViSTA with proteomics and molecular 
virology, we define virus-host interactions for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 
anti-apoptotic protein, pUL37x1. We find that spatiotemporal controlled 
interactions underlie pUL37x1 functions, facilitating the pro-viral remodeling 
of mitochondria and peroxisomes during infection. Reciprocal isolations, 
microscopy, and genetic manipulations further characterize these associations, 
revealing the interplay between pUL37x1 and the MIB complex, which is critical 
for mitochondrial integrity. At the peroxisome, we show that pUL37x1 activates 
PEX11β to regulate fission, a key aspect of virus assembly and spread.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a positive 
single-stranded RNA virus, engages in complex interactions with host cell 
proteins throughout its life cycle. While these interactions enable the host to 
recognize and inhibit viral replication, they also facilitate essential viral 
processes such as transcription, translation, and replication. Many aspects of 
these virus-host interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we employed the 
catRAPID algorithm and utilized the RNA-protein interaction detection coupled 
with mass spectrometry technology to predict and validate the host proteins that 
specifically bind to the highly structured 5' and 3' terminal regions of the 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Among the interactions identified, we prioritized pseudouridine 
synthase PUS7, which binds to both ends of the viral RNA. Using nanopore direct 
RNA sequencing, we discovered that the viral RNA undergoes extensive 
post-transcriptional modifications. Modified consensus regions for PUS7 were 
identified at both terminal regions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including one in the 
viral transcription regulatory sequence leader. Collectively, our findings offer 
insights into host protein interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 UTRs and highlight 
the likely significance of pseudouridine synthases and other 
post-transcriptional modifications in the viral life cycle. This new knowledge 
enhances our understanding of virus-host dynamics and could inform the 
development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

Protein modification with poly-ubiquitin chains is a crucial process involved in 
a myriad of cellular pathways. Chain synthesis requires two steps: substrate 
modification with ubiquitin (priming) followed by repetitive 
ubiquitin-to-ubiquitin attachment (elongation). RING-type E3 ligases catalyze 
both reactions in collaboration with specific priming and elongating E2 enzymes. 
We provide kinetic insight into poly-ubiquitylation during protein quality 
control by showing that priming is the rate-determining step in protein 
degradation as directed by the yeast ERAD RING E3 ligases, Hrd1 and Doa10. Doa10 
cooperates with the dedicated priming E2, Ubc6, while both E3s use Ubc7 for 
elongation. Here, we provide direct evidence that Hrd1 uses Ubc7 also for 
priming. We found that Ubc6 has an unusually high basal activity that does not 
require strong stimulation from an E3. Doa10 exploits this property to pair with 
Ubc6 over Ubc7 during priming. Our work not only illuminates the mechanisms of 
specific E2/E3 interplay in ERAD, but also offers a basis to understand how RING 
E3s may have properties that are tailored to pair with their preferred E2s.

The recent pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus resulted in the greatest 
global health crisis since the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. There is limited 
knowledge of whether SARS-CoV-2 is physically associated with human 
metalloproteins. Recently, high-confidence, experimentally supported 
protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins were 
reported. In this work, 58 metalloproteins among these human targets have been 
identified by a structure-based approach. This study reveals that most human 
metalloproteins interact with the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein, 
whose antibodies are one of the principal markers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. 
Furthermore, this work provides sufficient evidence to conclude that Zn2+ plays 
an important role in the interplay between the novel coronavirus and humans. 
First, the content of Zn-binding proteins in the involved human metalloproteome 
is significantly higher than that of the other metal ions. Second, a molecular 
linkage between the identified human Zn-binding proteome with underlying medical 
conditions, that might increase the risk of severe illness from the SARS-CoV-2

Human sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase that primarily 
functions in the cytoplasm, where it can regulate α-tubulin acetylation levels. 
SIRT2 is linked to cancer progression, neurodegeneration, and infection with 
bacteria or viruses. However, the current knowledge about its interactions and 
the means through which it exerts its functions has remained limited. Here, we 
aimed to gain a better understanding of its cellular functions by characterizing 
SIRT2 subcellular localization, the identity and relative stability of its 
protein interactions, and its impact on the proteome of primary human 
fibroblasts. To assess the relative stability of SIRT2 interactions, we used 
immunoaffinity purification in conjunction with both label-free and metabolic 
labeling quantitative mass spectrometry. In addition to the expected 
associations with cytoskeleton proteins, including its known substrate TUBA1A, 
our results reveal that SIRT2 specifically interacts with proteins functioning 
in membrane trafficking, secretory processes, and transcriptional regulation. By 
quantifying their relative stability, we found most interactions to be 
transient, indicating a dynamic SIRT2 environment. We discover that SIRT2 
localizes to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and that this 
recruitment requires an intact ER-Golgi trafficking pathway. Further expanding 
these findings, we used microscopy and interaction assays to establish the 
interaction and coregulation of SIRT2 with liprin-β1 scaffolding protein 
(PPFiBP1), a protein with roles in focal adhesions disassembly. As SIRT2 
functions may be accomplished via interactions, enzymatic activity, and 
transcriptional regulation, we next assessed the impact of SIRT2 levels on the 
cellular proteome. SIRT2 knockdown led to changes in the levels of proteins 
functioning in membrane trafficking, including some of its interaction partners. 
Altogether, our study expands the knowledge of SIRT2 cytoplasmic functions to 
define a previously unrecognized involvement in intracellular trafficking 
pathways, which may contribute to its roles in cellular homeostasis and human 
diseases.

T cells are known to contribute to immune protection against scrub typhus, a 
potentially fatal infection caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium 
Orientia (O.) tsutsugamushi. However, the contribution of CD8+ T cells to 
protection and pathogenesis during O. tsutsugamushi infection is still unknown. 
Using our recently developed BALB/c mouse model that is based on footpad 
inoculation of the human-pathogenic Karp strain, we show that activated CD8+ T 
cells infiltrate spleen and lung during the third week of infection. Depletion 
of CD8+ T cells with monoclonal antibodies resulted in uncontrolled pathogen 
growth and mortality. Adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells from infected animals 
protected naïve BALB/c mice from lethal outcome of intraperitoneal challenge. In 
C57Bl/6 mice, the pulmonary lymphocyte compartment showed an increased 
percentage of CD8+ T cells for at least 135 days post O. tsutsugamushi 
infection. Depletion of CD8+ T cells at 84 days post infection caused 
reactivation of bacterial growth. In CD8+ T cell-deficient beta 2-microglobulin 
knockout mice, bacterial replication was uncontrolled, and all mice succumbed to 
the infection, despite higher serum IFN-γ levels and stronger macrophage 
responses in liver and lung. Moreover, we show that CD8+ T cells but not NKT 
cells were required for hepatocyte injury: elevated concentrations of serum 
alanine aminotransferase and infection-induced subcapsular necrotic liver 
lesions surrounded by macrophages were found in C57Bl/6 and CD1d-deficient mice, 
but not in beta 2-microglobulin knockout mice. In the lungs, peribronchial 
macrophage infiltrations also depended on CD8+ T cells. In summary, our results 
demonstrate that CD8+ T cells restrict growth of O. tsutsugamushi during acute 
and persistent infection, and are required to protect from lethal infections in 
BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. However, they also elicit specific pathologic tissue 
lesions in liver and lung.

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) play an important role in the phenotype 
prediction of microorganisms, and their accuracy can be further improved by 
integrating other types of biological data such as enzyme concentrations and 
kinetic coefficients. Enzyme-constrained models (ecModels) have been constructed 
for several species and were successfully applied to increase the production of 
commodity chemicals. However, there was still no genome-scale ecModel for the 
important model organism Bacillus subtilis prior to this study. Here, we 
integrated enzyme kinetic and proteomic data to construct the first genome-scale 
ecModel of B. subtilis (ecBSU1) using the ECMpy workflow. We first used ecBSU1 
to simulate overflow metabolism and explore the trade-off between biomass yield 
and enzyme usage efficiency. Next, we simulated the growth rate on eight 
previously published substrates and found that the simulation results of ecBSU1 
were in good agreement with the literature. Finally, we identified target genes 
that enhance the yield of commodity chemicals using ecBSU1, most of which were 
consistent with the experimental data, and some of which may be potential novel 
targets for metabolic engineering. This work demonstrates that the integration 
of enzymatic constraints is an effective method to improve the performance of 
GEMs. The ecModel can predict overflow metabolism more precisely and can be used 
for the identification of target genes to guide the rational design of microbial 
cell factories.

The conserved regulon of heat shock factor 1 in budding yeast contains 
chaperones for general protein folding as well as zinc-finger protein Zpr1, 
whose essential role in archaea and eukaryotes remains unknown. Here, we show 
that Zpr1 depletion causes acute proteotoxicity driven by biosynthesis of 
misfolded eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). Prolonged Zpr1 
depletion leads to eEF1A insufficiency, thereby inducing the integrated stress 
response and inhibiting protein synthesis. Strikingly, we show by using two 
distinct biochemical reconstitution approaches that Zpr1 enables eEF1A to 
achieve a conformational state resistant to protease digestion. Lastly, we use a 
ColabFold model of the Zpr1-eEF1A complex to reveal a folding mechanism mediated 
by the Zpr1's zinc-finger and alpha-helical hairpin structures. Our work 
uncovers the long-sought-after function of Zpr1 as a bespoke chaperone tailored 
to the biogenesis of one of the most abundant proteins in the cell.

The Cdc14 phosphatase family is highly conserved in fungi. In Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, Cdc14 is essential for down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 
activity at mitotic exit. However, this essential function is not broadly 
conserved and requires only a small fraction of normal Cdc14 activity. Here, we 
identified an invariant motif in the disordered C-terminal tail of fungal Cdc14 
enzymes that is required for full enzyme activity. Mutation of this motif 
reduced Cdc14 catalytic rate and provided a tool for studying the biological 
significance of high Cdc14 activity. A S. cerevisiae strain expressing the 
reduced-activity hypomorphic mutant allele (cdc14hm ) as the sole source of 
Cdc14 proliferated like the wild-type parent strain but exhibited an unexpected 
sensitivity to cell wall stresses, including chitin-binding compounds and 
echinocandin antifungal drugs. Sensitivity to echinocandins was also observed in 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans strains lacking CDC14, suggesting 
this phenotype reflects a novel and conserved function of Cdc14 orthologs in 
mediating fungal cell wall integrity. In C. albicans, the orthologous cdc14hm 
allele was sufficient to elicit echinocandin hypersensitivity and perturb cell 
wall integrity signaling. It also caused striking abnormalities in septum 
structure and the same cell separation and hyphal differentiation defects 
previously observed with cdc14 gene deletions. Since hyphal differentiation is 
important for C. albicans pathogenesis, we assessed the effect of reduced Cdc14 
activity on virulence in Galleria mellonella and mouse models of invasive 
candidiasis. Partial reduction in Cdc14 activity via cdc14hm mutation severely 
impaired C. albicans virulence in both assays. Our results reveal that high 
Cdc14 activity is important for C. albicans cell wall integrity and pathogenesis 
and suggest that Cdc14 may be worth future exploration as an antifungal drug 
target.

mRNA decay plays an essential role in the control of gene expression in 
bacteria. Exoribonucleases (exoRNases), which trim transcripts starting from the 
5' or 3' end, are particularly important to fully degrade unwanted transcripts 
and renew the pool of nucleotides available in the cell. While recent techniques 
have allowed genome-wide identification of ribonuclease (RNase) targets in 
bacteria in vivo, none of the 3'-to-5' exoRNase targetomes (i.e., global 
processing sites) have been studied so far. Here, we report the targetomes of 
YhaM, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), and RNase R of the human pathogen 
Streptococcus pyogenes We determined that YhaM is an unspecific enzyme that 
trims a few nucleotides and targets the majority of transcript ends, generated 
either by transcription termination or by endonucleolytic activity. The 
molecular determinants for YhaM-limited processivity are yet to be deciphered. 
We showed that PNPase clears the cell from mRNA decay fragments produced by 
endoribonucleases (endoRNases) and is the major 3'-to-5' exoRNase for RNA 
turnover in S. pyogenes In particular, PNPase is responsible for the degradation 
of regulatory elements from 5' untranslated regions. However, we observed little 
RNase R activity in standard culture conditions. Overall, our study sheds light 
on the very distinct features of S. pyogenes 3'-to-5' exoRNases.

The mechanisms for maintaining oral cavity homeostasis are subject to the 
constant influence of many environmental factors, including various chemicals 
and microorganisms. Most of them act directly on the oral mucosa, which is the 
mechanical and immune barrier of the oral cavity, and such interaction might 
lead to the development of various oral pathologies and systemic diseases. Two 
important players in maintaining oral health or developing oral pathology are 
the oral microbiota and various immune molecules that are involved in 
controlling its quantitative and qualitative composition. The LL-37 peptide is 
an important molecule that upon release from human cathelicidin (hCAP-18) can 
directly perform antimicrobial action after insertion into surface structures of 
microorganisms and immunomodulatory function as an agonist of different cell 
membrane receptors. Oral LL-37 expression is an important factor in oral 
homeostasis that maintains the physiological microbiota but is also involved in 
the development of oral dysbiosis, infectious diseases (including viral, 
bacterial, and fungal infections), autoimmune diseases, and oral carcinomas. 
This peptide has also been proposed as a marker of inflammation severity and 
treatment outcome.

BACKGROUND: Two important challenges in the analysis of molecular biology 
information are data (multi-omic information) integration and the detection of 
patterns across large scale molecular networks and sequences. They are are 
actually coupled beause the integration of omic information may provide better 
means to detect multi-omic patterns that could reveal multi-scale or emerging 
properties at the phenotype levels.
RESULTS: Here we address the problem of integrating various types of molecular 
information (a large collection of gene expression and sequence data, codon 
usage and protein abundances) to analyse the E.coli metabolic response to 
treatments at the whole network level. Our algorithm, MORA (Multi-omic relations 
adjacency) is able to detect patterns which may represent metabolic network 
motifs at pathway and supra pathway levels which could hint at some functional 
role. We provide a description and insights on the algorithm by testing it on a 
large database of responses to antibiotics. Along with the algorithm MORA, a 
novel model for the analysis of oscillating multi-omics has been proposed. 
Interestingly, the resulting analysis suggests that some motifs reveal recurring 
oscillating or position variation patterns on multi-omics metabolic networks. 
Our framework, implemented in R, provides effective and friendly means to design 
intervention scenarios on real data. By analysing how multi-omics data build up 
multi-scale phenotypes, the software allows to compare and test metabolic 
models, design new pathways or redesign existing metabolic pathways and validate 
in silico metabolic models using nearby species.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of multi-omic data reveals that E.coli multi-omic 
metabolic networks contain position dependent and recurring patterns which could 
provide clues of long range correlations in the bacterial genome.

In the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for R-loop structures 
as important regulators of the epigenome, telomere maintenance, DNA repair, and 
replication. Given these numerous functions, dozens, or potentially hundreds, of 
proteins could serve as direct or indirect regulators of R-loop writing, 
reading, and erasing. In order to understand common properties shared amongst 
potential R-loop binding proteins, we mined published proteomic studies and 
distilled 10 features that were enriched in R-loop binding proteins compared 
with the rest of the proteome. Applying an easy-ensemble machine learning 
approach, we used these R-loop binding protein-specific features along with 
their amino acid composition to create random forest classifiers that predict 
the likelihood of a protein to bind to R-loops. Known R-loop regulating pathways 
such as splicing, DNA damage repair and chromatin remodeling are highly enriched 
in our datasets, and we validate 2 new R-loop binding proteins LIG1 and FXR1 in 
human cells. Together these datasets provide a reference to pursue analyses of 
novel R-loop regulatory proteins.

Sjögren syndrome/scleroderma autoantigen 1 (SSSCA1) was first described as an 
auto-antigen over-expressed in Sjögren's syndrome and in scleroderma patients. 
SSSCA1 has been linked to mitosis and centromere association and as a potential 
marker candidate in diverse solid cancers. Here we characterize SSSCA1 for the 
first time, to our knowledge, at the molecular, structural and subcellular 
level. We have determined the crystal structure of a zinc finger fold, a zinc 
ribbon domain type 2 (ZNRD2), at 2.3 Å resolution. We show that the C-terminal 
domain serves a dual function as it both behaves as the interaction site to 
Tankyrase 1 (TNKS1) and as a nuclear export signal. We identify TNKS1 as a 
direct binding partner of SSSCA1, map the binding site to TNKS1 ankyrin repeat 
cluster 2 (ARC2) and thus define a new binding sequence. We experimentally 
verify and map a new nuclear export signal sequence in SSSCA1.

E. coli is one of the most widely used organisms for understanding the 
principles of cellular and molecular genetics. However, we are yet to understand 
the origin of several experimental observations related to the regulation of 
gene expression in E. coli. One of the prominent examples in this context is the 
proportional synthesis in multiprotein complexes where all of their obligate 
subunits are produced in proportion to their stoichiometry. In this work, by 
combining the next-generation sequencing data with the stochastic simulations of 
protein synthesis, we explain the origin of proportional protein synthesis in 
multicomponent complexes. We find that the estimated initiation rates for the 
translation of all subunits in those complexes are proportional to their 
stoichiometry. This constraint on protein synthesis kinetics enforces 
proportional protein synthesis without requiring any feedback mechanism. We also 
find that the translation initiation rates in E. coli are influenced by the 
coding sequence length and the enrichment of A and C nucleotides near the start 
codon. Thus, this study rationalizes the role of conserved and nonrandom 
features of genes in regulating the translation kinetics and unravels a key 
principle of the regulation of protein synthesis.

The biological significance of the DHTKD1-encoded 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase 
(OADH) remains obscure due to its catalytic redundancy with the ubiquitous 
OGDH-encoded 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH). In this work, metabolic 
contributions of OADH and OGDH are discriminated by exposure of cells/tissues 
with different DHTKD1 expression to the synthesized phosphonate analogues of 
homologous 2-oxodicarboxylates. The saccharopine pathway intermediates and 
phosphorylated sugars are abundant when cellular expressions of DHTKD1 and OGDH 
are comparable, while nicotinate and non-phosphorylated sugars are when DHTKD1 
expression is order(s) of magnitude lower than that of OGDH. Using succinyl, 
glutaryl and adipoyl phosphonates on the enzyme preparations from tissues with 
varied DHTKD1 expression reveals the contributions of OADH and OGDH to oxidation 
of 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate in vitro. In the phosphonates-treated cells 
with the high and low DHTKD1 expression, adipate or glutarate, correspondingly, 
are the most affected metabolites. The marker of fatty acid β-oxidation, 
adipate, is mostly decreased by the shorter, OGDH-preferring, phosphonate, in 
agreement with the known OGDH dependence of β-oxidation. The longest, 
OADH-preferring, phosphonate mostly affects the glutarate level. Coupled 
decreases in sugars and nicotinate upon the OADH inhibition link the 
perturbation in glucose homeostasis, known in OADH mutants, to the 
nicotinate-dependent NAD metabolism.

Recent research has identified glycation as a non-enzymatic post-translational 
modification of proteins in plants with a potential contributory role to the 
functional impairment of the plant proteome. Reducing sugars with a free 
aldehyde or ketone group such as glucose, fructose and galactose react with the 
N-terminal and lysine side chain amino groups of proteins. A common early-stage 
glycation adduct formed from glucose is Nε-fructosyl-lysine (FL). 
Saccharide-derived reactive dicarbonyls are arginine residue-directed glycating 
agents, forming advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). A dominant dicarbonyl is 
methylglyoxal-formed mainly by the trace-level degradation of triosephosphates, 
including through the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. Methylglyoxal forms the 
major quantitative AGE, hydroimidazolone MG-H1. Glucose and methylglyoxal 
concentrations in plants change with the developmental stage, senescence, light 
and dark cycles and also likely biotic and abiotic stresses. Proteomics analysis 
indicates that there is an enrichment of the amino acid residue targets of 
glycation, arginine and lysine residues, in predicted functional sites of the 
plant proteome, suggesting the susceptibility of proteins to functional 
inactivation by glycation. In this review, we give a brief introduction to 
glycation, glycating agents and glycation adducts in plants. We consider 
dicarbonyl stress, the functional vulnerability of the plant proteome to 
arginine-directed glycation and the likely role of methylglyoxal-mediated 
glycation in the activation of the unfolded protein response in plants. The 
latter is linked to the recent suggestion of protein glycation in sugar 
signaling in plant metabolism. The overexpression of glyoxalase 1, which 
suppresses glycation by methylglyoxal and glyoxal, produced plants resistant to 
high salinity, drought, extreme temperature and other stresses. Further research 
to decrease protein glycation in plants may lead to improved plant growth and 
assist the breeding of plant varieties resistant to environmental stress and 
senescence-including plants of commercial ornamental and crop cultivation value.

Glycation as a type of non-enzymatic protein modification is related to aging 
and chronic diseases, especially diabetes. Global analysis of protein glycation 
will aid in a better understanding of its formation mechanism and biological 
significance. In this work, we comprehensively investigated protein glycation in 
human cells (HEK293T, Jurkat, and MCF7 cells). The current results indicated 
that this non-enzymatic modification was not random, and protein at the 
extracellular regions and the nucleus were more frequently glycated. Systematic 
and site-specific analysis of glycated proteins allowed us to study the effect 
of the primary sequences and secondary structures of proteins on glycation. 
Furthermore, nearly every enzyme in the glycolytic pathway was found to be 
glycated and a possible mechanism was proposed. Many glycation sites were also 
previously reported as acetylation and ubiquitination sites, which strongly 
suggested that this non-enzymatic modification may disturb protein degradation 
and gene expression. The current results will facilitate further studies of 
protein glycation in biomedical and clinical research.

The major human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site endonuclease, APEX1, is a 
central player in the base excision DNA repair (BER) pathway and has a role in 
the regulation of DNA binding by transcription factors. In vertebrates, APEX1 
knockouts are embryonic lethal, and only a handful of knockout cell lines are 
known. To facilitate studies of multiple functions of this protein in human 
cells, we have used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out the APEX1 gene in a 
widely used non-cancer hypotriploid HEK 293FT cell line. Two stable knockout 
lines were obtained, one carrying two single-base deletion alleles and one 
single-base insertion allele in exon 3, another homozygous in the single-base 
insertion allele. Both mutations cause a frameshift that leads to premature 
translation termination before the start of the protein's catalytic domain. Both 
cell lines totally lacked the APEX1 protein and AP site-cleaving activity, and 
showed significantly lower levels of the APEX1 transcript. The APEX1-null cells 
were unable to support BER on uracil- or AP site-containing substrates. 
Phenotypically, they showed a moderately increased sensitivity to methyl 
methanesulfonate (MMS; ~2-fold lower EC50 compared with wild-type cells), and 
their background level of natural AP sites detected by the aldehyde-reactive 
probe was elevated ~1.5-2-fold. However, the knockout lines retained a nearly 
wild-type sensitivity to oxidizing agents hydrogen peroxide and potassium 
bromate. Interestingly, despite the increased MMS cytotoxicity, we observed no 
additional increase in AP sites in knockout cells upon MMS treatment, which 
could indicate their conversion into more toxic products in the absence of 
repair. Overall, the relatively mild cell phenotype in the absence of 
APEX1-dependent BER suggests that mammalian cells possess mechanisms of 
tolerance or alternative repair of AP sites. The knockout derivatives of the 
extensively characterized HEK 293FT cell line may provide a valuable tool for 
studies of APEX1 in DNA repair and beyond.

Post-translational modification of ribosomal proteins enables rapid and dynamic 
regulation of protein biogenesis. Site-specific ubiquitylation of 40S ribosomal 
proteins uS10 and eS10 plays a key role during ribosome-associated quality 
control (RQC). Distinct, and previously functionally ambiguous, ubiquitylation 
events on the 40S proteins uS3 and uS5 are induced by diverse proteostasis 
stressors that impact translation activity. Here, we identify the ubiquitin 
ligase RNF10 and the deubiquitylating enzyme USP10 as the key enzymes that 
regulate uS3 and uS5 ubiquitylation. Prolonged uS3 and uS5 ubiquitylation 
results in 40S, but not 60S, ribosomal protein degradation in a manner 
independent of canonical autophagy. We show that blocking progression of either 
scanning or elongating ribosomes past the start codon triggers site-specific 
ubiquitylation events on ribosomal proteins uS5 and uS3. This study identifies 
and characterizes a distinct arm in the RQC pathway, initiation RQC (iRQC), that 
acts on 40S ribosomes during translation initiation to modulate translation 
activity and capacity.

Gene expression is imperfect, sometimes leading to toxic products. Solutions 
take two forms: globally reducing error rates, or ensuring that the consequences 
of erroneous expression are relatively harmless. The latter is optimal, but 
because it must evolve independently at so many loci, it is subject to a 
stringent "drift barrier"-a limit to how weak the effects of a deleterious 
mutation s can be, while still being effectively purged by selection, expressed 
in terms of the population size N of an idealized population such that purging 
requires s < -1/N In previous work, only large populations evolved the optimal 
local solution, small populations instead evolved globally low error rates, and 
intermediate populations were bistable, with either solution possible. Here, we 
take into consideration the fact that the effectiveness of purging varies among 
loci, because of variation in gene expression level, and variation in the 
intrinsic vulnerabilities of different gene products to error. The previously 
found dichotomy between the two kinds of solution breaks down, replaced by a 
gradual transition as a function of population size. In the extreme case of a 
small enough population, selection fails to maintain even the global solution 
against deleterious mutations, explaining the nonmonotonic relationship between 
effective population size and transcriptional error rate that was recently 
observed in experiments on Escherichia coli, Caenorhabditis elegans, and 
Buchnera aphidicola.

Recombinant protein production is a key process in generating proteins of 
interest in the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research. However, about 
50% of recombinant proteins fail to be expressed in a variety of host cells. 
Here we show that the accessibility of translation initiation sites modelled 
using the mRNA base-unpairing across the Boltzmann's ensemble significantly 
outperforms alternative features. This approach accurately predicts the 
successes or failures of expression experiments, which utilised Escherichia coli 
cells to express 11,430 recombinant proteins from over 189 diverse species. On 
this basis, we develop TIsigner that uses simulated annealing to modify up to 
the first nine codons of mRNAs with synonymous substitutions. We show that 
accessibility captures the key propensity beyond the target region (initiation 
sites in this case), as a modest number of synonymous changes is sufficient to 
tune the recombinant protein expression levels. We build a stochastic simulation 
model and show that higher accessibility leads to higher protein production and 
slower cell growth, supporting the idea of protein cost, where cell growth is 
constrained by protein circuits during overexpression.

Protein copy numbers constrain systems-level properties of regulatory networks, 
but proportional proteomic data remain scarce compared to RNA-seq. We related 
mRNA to protein statistically using best-available data from quantitative 
proteomics and transcriptomics for 4366 genes in 369 cell lines. The approach 
starts with a protein's median copy number and hierarchically appends 
mRNA-protein and mRNA-mRNA dependencies to define an optimal gene-specific model 
linking mRNAs to protein. For dozens of cell lines and primary samples, these 
protein inferences from mRNA outmatch stringent null models, a count-based 
protein-abundance repository, empirical mRNA-to-protein ratios, and a 
proteogenomic DREAM challenge winner. The optimal mRNA-to-protein relationships 
capture biological processes along with hundreds of known protein-protein 
complexes, suggesting mechanistic relationships. We use the method to identify a 
viral-receptor abundance threshold for coxsackievirus B3 susceptibility from 
1489 systems-biology infection models parameterized by protein inference. When 
applied to 796 RNA-seq profiles of breast cancer, inferred copy-number estimates 
collectively re-classify 26-29% of luminal tumors. By adopting a gene-centered 
perspective of mRNA-protein covariation across different biological contexts, we 
achieve accuracies comparable to the technical reproducibility of contemporary 
proteomics.

Despite differences in the pathogenesis and host range of alphaherpesviruses, 
many stages of their morphogenesis are thought to be conserved. Here, an 
ultrastructural study of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) envelopment revealed 
profiles similar to those previously found for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), 
with BoHV-1 capsids associating with endocytic tubules. Consistent with the 
similarity of their genomes and envelopment strategies, the proteomic 
compositions of BoHV-1 and HSV-1 virions were also comparable. However, BoHV-1 
morphogenesis exhibited a diversity in envelopment events. First, heterogeneous 
primary envelopment profiles were readily detectable at the inner nuclear 
membrane of BoHV-1-infected cells. Second, the BoHV-1 progeny comprised not just 
full virions but also an abundance of capsidless, noninfectious light particles 
(L-particles) that were released from the infected cells in numbers similar to 
those of virions and in the absence of DNA replication. Proteomic analysis of 
BoHV-1 L-particles and the much less abundant HSV-1 L-particles revealed that 
they contained the same complement of envelope proteins as virions but showed 
variations in tegument content. In the case of HSV-1, the UL46 tegument protein 
was reproducibly found to be >6-fold enriched in HSV-1 L-particles. More 
strikingly, the tegument proteins UL36, UL37, UL21, and UL16 were depleted in 
BoHV-1 but not HSV-1 L-particles. We propose that these combined differences 
reflect the presence of truly segregated "inner" and "outer" teguments in 
BoHV-1, making it a critical system for studying the structure and process of 
tegumentation and envelopment.IMPORTANCE The alphaherpesvirus family includes 
viruses that infect humans and animals. Hence, not only do they have a 
significant impact on human health, but they also have a substantial economic 
impact on the farming industry. While the pathogenic manifestations of the 
individual viruses differ from host to host, their relative genetic compositions 
suggest similarity at the molecular level. This study provides a side-by-side 
comparison of the particle outputs from the major human pathogen HSV-1 and the 
veterinary pathogen BoHV-1. Ultrastructural and proteomic analyses have revealed 
that both viruses have broadly similar morphogenesis profiles and infectious 
virus compositions. However, the demonstration that BoHV-1 has the capacity to 
generate vast numbers of capsidless enveloped particles that differ from those 
produced by HSV-1 in composition implies a divergence in the cell biology of 
these viruses that impacts our general understanding of alphaherpesvirus 
morphogenesis.

Protein kinases play an important role in cellular signaling pathways and their 
dysregulation leads to multiple diseases, making kinases prime drug targets. 
While more than 500 human protein kinases are known to collectively mediate 
phosphorylation of over 290,000 S/T/Y sites, the activities have been 
characterized only for a minor, intensively studied subset. To systematically 
address this discrepancy, we developed a human kinase array in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae as a simple readout tool to systematically assess kinase activities. 
For this array, we expressed 266 human kinases in four different S. cerevisiae 
strains and profiled ectopic growth as a proxy for kinase activity across 33 
conditions. More than half of the kinases showed an activity-dependent phenotype 
across many conditions and in more than one strain. We then employed the kinase 
array to identify the kinase(s) that can modulate protein-protein interactions 
(PPIs). Two characterized, phosphorylation-dependent PPIs with unknown 
kinase-substrate relationships were analyzed in a phospho-yeast two-hybrid 
assay. CK2α1 and SGK2 kinases can abrogate the interaction between the 
spliceosomal proteins AAR2 and PRPF8, and NEK6 kinase was found to mediate the 
estrogen receptor (ERα) interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. The human kinase yeast 
array can thus be used for a variety of kinase activity-dependent readouts.

Translation affects messenger RNA stability and, in yeast, this is mediated by 
the Ccr4-Not deadenylation complex. The details of this process in mammals 
remain unclear. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and 
crosslinking mass spectrometry to show that mammalian CCR4-NOT specifically 
recognizes ribosomes that are stalled during translation elongation in an in 
vitro reconstituted system with rabbit and human components. Similar to yeast, 
mammalian CCR4-NOT inserts a helical bundle of its CNOT3 subunit into the empty 
E site of the ribosome. Our cryo-EM structure shows that CNOT3 also locks the L1 
stalk in an open conformation to inhibit further translation. CCR4-NOT is 
required for stable association of the nonconstitutive subunit CNOT4, which 
ubiquitinates the ribosome, likely to signal stalled translation elongation. 
Overall, our work shows that human CCR4-NOT not only detects but also enforces 
ribosomal stalling to couple translation and mRNA decay.

The transcription factor TOX has attracted attention in recent years for its 
role in CD8+ T cell exhaustion. In fact, TOX was known historically for its 
diverse roles in immune cell biology. Here, we inquire into the basis for this 
versatility, and propose that one main consideration is that TOX is an HMG-box 
transcription factor. We discuss some mechanisms that other HMG-box 
transcription factors employ to perform their cellular functions, as examples of 
the range of mechanisms TOX might employ in furthering T cell exhaustion. This 
inquiry begins with the literature placing TOX as a central player in CD8+ T 
cell exhaustion and in other immune cell processes. An understanding of TOX as a 
transcription factor has to be organized around its binding to relevant target 
sites in DNA. Thus, we next cover the reasons that TOX is classified as an 
HMG-box protein, the well-defined but narrow scope of what TOX shares with other 
HMG-box proteins, and the unequivocal evidence that binding of HMG-box proteins 
stabilizes kinked or bent DNA. We consider the constant features and some 
variables in DNA recognition by HMG-box proteins. Since binding and bending DNA 
is not in isolation an explanation of any biological process, we look at 
biological examples highlighting specific ways that HMG-box proteins drive 
cellular processes. Finally, we outline some lines of research that could be 
informative in understanding the cellular mechanisms of TOX in T cell 
exhaustion.

Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinases (PI5P4K), also known as type II PIPKs 
or PIPKIIs, convert the lipid second messenger PI5P to PI(4,5)P2. The PI5P4K 
family consists of three isozymes in mammals-PI5P4Kα, β, and γ-which notably 
utilize both GTP and ATP as phosphodonors. Unlike the other two isozymes, which 
can utilize both ATP and GTP, PI5P4Kβ exhibits a marked preference for GTP over 
ATP, acting as an intracellular GTP sensor that alters its kinase activity in 
response to physiological changes in GTP concentration. Knockout studies have 
demonstrated a critical role for PI5P4Kα and β in tumorigenesis, while PI5P4Kγ 
has been implicated in regulating immune and neural systems. Pharmacological 
targeting of PI5P4K holds promise for the development of new therapeutic 
approaches against cancer, immune dysfunction, and neurodegenerative diseases. 
Although several PI5P4K inhibitors have already been developed, challenges 
remain in PI5P4K inhibitor development, including a discrepancy between in vitro 
and cellular efficacy. This discrepancy is attributable to mainly three factors. 
(a) Most PI5P4K inhibitors were developed at low ATP levels, where these enzymes 
exhibit minimal activity. (b) Non-catalytic functions of PI5P4K require careful 
interpretation of PI5P4K depletion studies, as their scaffolding roles suppress 
class I PI3K signaling. (c) The lack of pharmacodynamic markers for in vivo 
assessment complicates efficacy assessment. To address these issues and promote 
the development of effective and targeted therapeutic strategies, this review 
provides an analytical overview of the distinct roles of individual isozymes and 
recent developments in PI5P4K inhibitors, emphasizing structural insights and 
the importance of pharmacodynamic marker identification.

Codon usage bias (CUB) refers to the phenomena that synonymous codons are used 
in different frequencies in most genes and organisms. The general assumption is 
that codon biases reflect a balance between mutational biases and natural 
selection. Today we understand that the codon content is related and can affect 
all gene expression steps. Starting from the 1980s, codon-based indices have 
been used for answering different questions in all biomedical fields, including 
systems biology, agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. In general, codon 
usage bias indices weigh each codon or a small set of codons to estimate the 
fitting of a certain coding sequence to a certain phenomenon (e.g., bias in 
codons, adaptation to the tRNA pool, frequencies of certain codons, 
transcription elongation speed, etc.) and are usually easy to implement. Today 
there are dozens of such indices; thus, this paper aims to review and compare 
the different codon usage bias indices, their applications, and advantages. In 
addition, we perform analysis that demonstrates that most indices tend to 
correlate even though they aim to capture different aspects. Due to the 
centrality of codon usage bias on different gene expression steps, it is 
important to keep developing new indices that can capture additional aspects 
that are not modeled with the current indices.

The danger signals that activate the NLRP1 inflammasome have not been 
established. Here, we report that the oxidized, but not the reduced, form of 
thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) binds to NLRP1. We found that oxidized TRX1 associates with 
the NACHT-LRR region of NLRP1 in an ATP-dependent process, forming a stable 
complex that restrains inflammasome activation. Consistent with these findings, 
patient-derived and ATPase-inactivating mutations in the NACHT-LRR region that 
cause hyperactive inflammasome formation interfere with TRX1 binding. Overall, 
this work strongly suggests that reductive stress, the cellular perturbation 
that will eliminate oxidized TRX1 and abrogate the TRX1-NLRP1 interaction, is a 
danger signal that activates the NLRP1 inflammasome.

[URE3] is an amyloid-based prion of Ure2p, a negative regulator of poor nitrogen 
source catabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overproduced Btn2p or its paralog 
Cur1p, in processes requiring Hsp42, cure the [URE3] prion. Btn2p cures by 
collecting Ure2p amyloid filaments at one place in the cell. We find that 
rpl4aΔ, rpl21aΔ, rpl21bΔ, rpl11bΔ, and rpl16bΔ (large ribosomal subunit 
proteins) or ubr2Δ (ubiquitin ligase targeting Rpn4p, an activator of proteasome 
genes) reduce curing by overproduced Btn2p or Cur1p. Impaired curing in ubr2Δ or 
rpl21bΔ is restored by an rpn4Δ mutation. No effect of rps14aΔ or rps30bΔ on 
curing was observed, indicating that 60S subunit deficiency specifically impairs 
curing. Levels of Hsp42p, Sis1p, or Btn3p are unchanged in rpl4aΔ, rpl21bΔ, or 
ubr2Δ mutants. Overproduction of Cur1p or Btn2p was enhanced in rpn4Δ and hsp42Δ 
mutants, lower in ubr2Δ strains, and restored to above wild-type levels in rpn4Δ 
ubr2Δ strains. As in the wild-type, Ure2N-GFP colocalizes with Btn2-RFP in 
rpl4aΔ, rpl21bΔ, or ubr2Δ strains, but not in hsp42Δ. Btn2p/Cur1p overproduction 
cures [URE3] variants with low seed number, but seed number is not increased in 
rpl4aΔ, rpl21bΔ or ubr2Δ mutants. Knockouts of genes required for the protein 
sorting function of Btn2p did not affect curing of [URE3], nor did inactivation 
of the Hsp104 prion-curing activity. Overactivity of the ubiquitin/proteasome 
system, resulting from 60S subunit deficiency or ubr2Δ, may impair Cur1p and 
Btn2p curing of [URE3] by degrading Cur1p, Btn2p or another component of these 
curing systems.

Cancer cells are known to undergo metabolic adaptation to cater to their 
enhanced energy demand. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential 
metabolite regulating many cellular processes within the cell. The enzymes 
required for NAD synthesis, starting from the base precursor - tryptophan, are 
expressed in the liver and the kidney, while all other tissues convert NAD from 
intermediate precursors. The liver, being an active metabolic organ, is a 
primary contributor to NAD biosynthesis. Inhibition of key enzymes in the NAD 
biosynthetic pathways is proposed as a strategy for designing anti-cancer drugs. 
On the other hand, NAD supplementation has also been reported to be beneficial 
in cancer in some cases. As metabolic adaptation that occurs in cancer cells can 
lead to perturbations to the pathways, it is important to understand the exact 
nature of the perturbation in each individual patient. To investigate this, we 
use a mathematical modelling approach integrated with transcriptomes of patient 
samples from the TCGA-LIHC cohort. Quantitative profiling of the NAD 
biosynthesis pathway helps us understand the NAD biosynthetic status and changes 
in the controlling steps of the pathway. Our results indicate that NAD 
biosynthesis is heterogeneous among liver cancer patients, and that Nicotinate 
phosphoribosyl transferase (NAPRT) levels are indicative of the NAD biosynthetic 
status. Further, we find that reduced NAPRT levels combined with reduced 
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) levels contribute to poor 
prognosis. Identification of the precise subgroup who may benefit from NAD 
supplementation in subgroup with low levels of NAPRT and NAMPT could be explored 
to improve patient outcome.

In eukaryotes, the organization and function of the microtubule cytoskeleton 
depend on the allocation of different roles to individual microtubules. For 
example, many asymmetrically dividing cells differentially specify microtubule 
behavior at old and new centrosomes. Here we show that yeast spindle pole bodies 
(SPBs, yeast centrosomes) differentially control the plus-end dynamics and 
cargoes of their astral microtubules, remotely from the minus-end. The old SPB 
recruits the kinesin motor protein Kip2, which then translocates to the plus-end 
of the emanating microtubules, promotes their extension and delivers dynein into 
the bud. Kip2 recruitment at the SPB depends on Bub2 and Bfa1, and 
phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Kip2 prevents random lattice binding. Releasing 
Kip2 of its control by SPBs equalizes its distribution, the length of 
microtubules and dynein distribution between the mother cell and its bud. These 
observations reveal that microtubule organizing centers use minus to plus-end 
directed remote control to individualize microtubule function.

Human cells make use of hundreds of unique ubiquitin E3 ligases to ensure 
proteome fidelity and control cellular functions by promoting protein 
degradation. These processes require exquisite selectivity, but the individual 
roles of most E3s remain poorly characterized in part due to the challenges 
associated with identifying, quantifying, and validating substrates for each E3. 
We report an integrative mass spectrometry (MS) strategy for characterizing 
protein fragments that interact with KLHDC2, a human E3 that recognizes the 
extreme C-terminus of substrates. Using a combination of native MS, native 
top-down MS, MS of destabilized samples, and liquid chromatography MS, we 
identified and quantified a near complete fraction of the KLHDC2-binding 
peptidome in E. coli cells. This degronome includes peptides that originate from 
a variety of proteins. Although all identified protein fragments are terminated 
by diglycine or glycylalanine, the preceding amino acids are diverse. These 
results significantly expand our understanding of the sequences that can be 
recognized by KLHDC2, which provides insight into the potential substrates of 
this E3 in humans. We anticipate that this integrative MS strategy could be 
leveraged more broadly to characterize the degronomes of other E3 ligase 
substrate receptors, including those that adhere to the more common N-end rule 
for substrate recognition. Therefore, this work advances "degronomics," i.e., 
identifying, quantifying, and validating functional E3:peptide interactions in 
order to determine the individual roles of each E3.

Viral proteins evolve to benefit the interaction with host proteins during the 
infection and replication processes. A comprehensive understanding of virus 
interactome with host proteins may thus lead to the identification of molecular 
targets for infection inhibition. We present a procedure for isolating and 
identifying the dengue virus interactome with human plasma proteins. It 
comprises the fractionation of human plasma by anion exchange chromatography, 
followed by affinity purification and mass spectrometry identification of the 
captured proteins. This procedure was applied to the characterization of the 
interactions of the four serotypes of dengue virus with human plasma proteins, 
mediated by the domain III of the envelope protein of the virus. The resulting 
interactome comprises 62 proteins, six of which were validated as new direct 
interactions of the virus with its human host.

Gene rv3722c of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is essential for in vitro growth, and 
encodes a putative pyridoxal phosphate-binding protein of unknown function. Here 
we use metabolomic, genetic and structural approaches to show that Rv3722c is 
the primary aspartate aminotransferase of M. tuberculosis, and mediates an 
essential but underrecognized role in metabolism: nitrogen distribution. Rv3722c 
deficiency leads to virulence attenuation in macrophages and mice. Our results 
identify aspartate biosynthesis and nitrogen distribution as potential 
species-selective drug targets in M. tuberculosis.

Foreign proteins are potentially immunogenic, and a proportion of these are able 
to induce immune responses that result in allergic sensitization. Subsequent 
exposure of sensitized subjects to the inducing protein can provoke a variety of 
allergic reactions that may be severe, or even fatal. It has therefore been 
recognized for some time that it is important to determine a priori whether a 
given protein has the potential to induce allergic responses in exposed 
subjects. For example, the need to assess whether transgene products expressed 
in genetically engineered crop plants have allergenic properties. This is not 
necessarily a straightforward exercise (as discussed elsewhere in this edition), 
but the task becomes even more challenging when there is a need to conduct an 
overall allergenicity safety assessment of complex mixtures of proteins in 
botanicals or other natural sources that are to be used in consumer products. 
This paper describes a new paradigm for the allergenicity safety assessment of 
proteins that is based on the use of AllerCatPro 2.0, a new version of a 
previously described web application model developed for the characterization of 
the allergenic potential of proteins. Operational aspects of AllerCatPro 2.0 are 
described with emphasis on the application of new features that provide 
improvements in the predictions of allergenic properties such as the 
identification of proteins with high allergenic concern. Furthermore, the paper 
provides a description of strategies of how AllerCatPro 2.0 can best be deployed 
as a screening tool for identifying suitable proteins as ingredients in consumer 
products as well as a tool, in conjunction with label-free proteomic analysis, 
for identifying and semiquantifying protein allergens in complex materials. 
Lastly, the paper discusses the steps that are recommended for formal 
allergenicity safety assessment of novel consumer products which contain 
proteins, including consideration and integration of predicted consumer exposure 
metrics. The article therefore provides a holistic perspective of the processes 
through which effective protein safety assessments can be made of potential 
allergenic hazards and risks associated with exposure to proteins in consumer 
products, with a particular focus on the use of AllerCatPro 2.0 for this 
purpose.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae type 2C protein phosphatase Ptc1 is required for a 
wide variety of cellular functions, although only a few cellular targets have 
been identified. A genetic screen in search of mutations in protein 
kinase-encoding genes able to suppress multiple phenotypic traits caused by the 
ptc1 deletion yielded a single gene, MKK1, coding for a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) 
known to activate the cell-wall integrity (CWI) Slt2 MAPK. In contrast, mutation 
of the MKK1 paralog, MKK2, had a less significant effect. Deletion of MKK1 
abolished the increased phosphorylation of Slt2 induced by the absence of Ptc1 
both under basal and CWI pathway stimulatory conditions. We demonstrate that 
Ptc1 acts at the level of the MAPKKs of the CWI pathway, but only the Mkk1 
kinase activity is essential for ptc1 mutants to display high Slt2 activation. 
We also show that Ptc1 is able to dephosphorylate Mkk1 in vitro. Our results 
reveal the preeminent role of Mkk1 in signaling through the CWI pathway and 
strongly suggest that hyperactivation of Slt2 caused by upregulation of Mkk1 is 
at the basis of most of the phenotypic defects associated with lack of Ptc1 
function.

Hybrids between species often show extreme phenotypes, including some that take 
place at the molecular level. In this study, we investigated the phenotypes of 
an interspecies diploid hybrid in terms of protein-protein interactions inferred 
from protein correlation profiling. We used two yeast species, Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae and Saccharomyces uvarum, which are interfertile, but yet have 
proteins diverged enough to be differentiated using mass spectrometry. Most of 
the protein-protein interactions are similar between hybrid and parents, and are 
consistent with the assembly of chimeric complexes, which we validated using an 
orthogonal approach for the prefoldin complex. We also identified instances of 
altered protein-protein interactions in the hybrid, for instance, in complexes 
related to proteostasis and in mitochondrial protein complexes. Overall, this 
study uncovers the likely frequent occurrence of chimeric protein complexes with 
few exceptions, which may result from incompatibilities or imbalances between 
the parental proteomes.

Integrative research about multiple biochemical subsystems has significant 
potential to help advance biology, bioengineering and medicine. However, it is 
difficult to obtain the diverse data needed for integrative research. To 
facilitate biochemical research, we developed Datanator 
(https://datanator.info), an integrated database and set of tools for finding 
clouds of multiple types of molecular data about specific molecules and 
reactions in specific organisms and environments, as well as data about 
chemically-similar molecules and reactions in phylogenetically-similar organisms 
in similar environments. Currently, Datanator includes metabolite 
concentrations, RNA modifications and half-lives, protein abundances and 
modifications, and reaction rate constants about a broad range of organisms. 
Going forward, we aim to launch a community initiative to curate additional 
data. Datanator also provides tools for filtering, visualizing and exporting 
these data clouds. We believe that Datanator can facilitate a wide range of 
research from integrative mechanistic models, such as whole-cell models, to 
comparative data-driven analyses of multiple organisms.

The PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database is one of the world-leading data 
repositories of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data. Since the 
beginning of 2014, PRIDE Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) is the 
new PRIDE archival system, replacing the original PRIDE database. Here we 
summarize the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the 
previous update manuscript in the Database Issue in 2013. PRIDE Archive 
constitutes a complete redevelopment of the original PRIDE, comprising a new 
storage backend, data submission system and web interface, among other 
components. PRIDE Archive supports the most-widely used PSI (Proteomics 
Standards Initiative) data standard formats (mzML and mzIdentML) and implements 
the data requirements and guidelines of the ProteomeXchange Consortium. The wide 
adoption of ProteomeXchange within the community has triggered an unprecedented 
increase in the number of submitted data sets (around 150 data sets per month). 
We outline some statistics on the current PRIDE Archive data contents. We also 
report on the status of the PRIDE related stand-alone tools: PRIDE Inspector, 
PRIDE Converter 2 and the ProteomeXchange submission tool. Finally, we will give 
a brief update on the resources under development 'PRIDE Cluster' and 'PRIDE 
Proteomes', which provide a complementary view and quality-scored information of 
the peptide and protein identification data available in PRIDE Archive.

The molecular pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome remains largely elusive in 
pediatric patients. While most children with minimal change disease (MCD) show 
favorable responses to immunosuppressive therapy, those with focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) often exhibit poorer treatment responses, with many 
experiencing either partial remission or no remission of proteinuria. The need 
for reliable glomerular disease biomarkers to predict treatment response and 
understand molecular pathways governing responsiveness and resistance is a 
critical unmet need in pediatric nephrology. In this study, we sought to 
characterize urine proteomes in children with MCD and FSGS to identify 
biomarkers distinguishing disease activity and associated molecular pathways. 
Using quantitative proteomics, urine proteins from children with MCD and FSGS in 
the CureGN Study were identified and correlated with disease onset and activity. 
Unbiased cluster analyses of nephrotic urine proteomes demonstrated a cluster 
with relatively increased immune response and complement proteins, suggesting 
important distinctions in disease characteristics within the nephrotic 
subgroups. These analyses yielded patient subpopulations with proteinuria and 
distinct urine proteome differences associated with 116 proteins exerting 
cluster separation in the multivariate analyses. These findings highlight the 
potential of unsupervised clustering to identify disease subgroups and provide 
insights into the underlying molecular heterogeneity within nephrotic syndrome, 
paving the way for more tailored therapeutic strategies and improved patient 
management.

A knowledge-based grouping of genes into pathways or functional units is 
essential for describing and understanding cellular complexity. However, it is 
not always clear a priori how and at what level of specificity functionally 
interconnected genes should be partitioned into pathways, for a given 
application. Here, we assess and compare nine existing and two conceptually 
novel functional classification systems, with respect to their discovery power 
and generality in gene set enrichment testing. We base our assessment on a 
collection of nearly 2000 functional genomics datasets provided by users of the 
STRING database. With these real-life and diverse queries, we assess which 
systems typically provide the most specific and complete enrichment results. We 
find many structural and performance differences between classification systems. 
Overall, the well-established, hierarchically organized pathway annotation 
systems yield the best enrichment performance, despite covering substantial 
parts of the human genome in general terms only. On the other hand, the more 
recent unsupervised annotation systems perform strongest in understudied areas 
and organisms, and in detecting more specific pathways, albeit with less 
informative labels.

Regulated expression of the Ena1 Na+-ATPase is a crucial event for adaptation to 
high salt and/or alkaline pH stress in the budding yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. ENA1 expression is under the control of diverse signaling pathways, 
including that mediated by the calcium-regulatable protein phosphatase 
calcineurin and its downstream transcription factor Crz1. We present here a 
quantitative study of the expression of Ena1 in response to alkalinization of 
the environment and we analyze the contribution of Crz1 to this response. 
Experimental data and mathematical models substantiate the existence of two 
stress-responsive Crz1-binding sites in the ENA1 promoter and estimate that the 
contribution of Crz1 to the early response of the ENA1 promoter is about 60%. 
The models suggest the existence of a second input with similar kinetics, which 
would be likely mediated by high pH-induced activation of the Snf1 kinase.

This paper presents a report on outcomes of the 10th Computational Modeling in 
Biology Network (COMBINE) meeting that was held in Heidelberg, Germany, in July 
of 2019. The annual event brings together researchers, biocurators and software 
engineers to present recent results and discuss future work in the area of 
standards for systems and synthetic biology. The COMBINE initiative coordinates 
the development of various community standards and formats for computational 
models in the life sciences. Over the past 10 years, COMBINE has brought 
together standard communities that have further developed and harmonized their 
standards for better interoperability of models and data. COMBINE 2019 was 
co-located with a stakeholder workshop of the European EU-STANDS4PM initiative 
that aims at harmonized data and model standardization for in silico models in 
the field of personalized medicine, as well as with the FAIRDOM PALs meeting to 
discuss findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data sharing. 
This report briefly describes the work discussed in invited and contributed 
talks as well as during breakout sessions. It also highlights recent 
advancements in data, model, and annotation standardization efforts. Finally, 
this report concludes with some challenges and opportunities that this community 
will face during the next 10 years.

Cells adapt to different conditions via gene expression that tunes metabolism 
for maximal fitness. Constraints on cellular proteome may limit such expression 
strategies and introduce trade-offs. Resource allocation under proteome 
constraints has explained regulatory strategies in bacteria. It is unclear, 
however, to what extent these constraints can predict evolutionary changes, 
especially for microorganisms that evolved under nutrient-rich conditions, i.e., 
multiple available nitrogen sources, such as Lactococcus lactis. Here, we 
present a proteome-constrained genome-scale metabolic model of L. lactis 
(pcLactis) to interpret growth on multiple nutrients. Through integration of 
proteomics and flux data, in glucose-limited chemostats, the model predicted 
glucose and arginine uptake as dominant constraints at low growth rates. Indeed, 
glucose and arginine catabolism were found upregulated in evolved mutants. At 
high growth rates, pcLactis correctly predicted the observed shutdown of 
arginine catabolism because limited proteome availability favored lactate for 
ATP production. Thus, our model-based analysis is able to identify and explain 
the proteome constraints that limit growth rate in nutrient-rich environments 
and thus form targets of fitness improvement.

SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1, otherwise known as SMOC-1, is a 
secreted glycoprotein involved in various cell biological processes including 
cell-matrix interactions, osteoblast differentiation, embryonic development, and 
homeostasis. SMOC-1 was found to be elevated in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) patient cortex as well as being enriched in amyloid plaques and in AD 
patientcerebrospinal fluid, arguing for SMOC-1 as a promising biomarker for AD. 
Having access to high-quality SMOC-1 antibodies is crucial for the scientific 
community. It can ensure the consistency and reliability of SMOC-1 research, and 
further the exploration of its potential as both a therapeutic target or 
diagnostic marker.. In this study, we characterized seven SMOC-1 commercial 
antibodies for Western blot and immunoprecipitation, using a standardized 
experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and 
isogenic parental controls. We identified successful antibodies in the tested 
applications and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the 
most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

Positive Selection and Centrality in the Yeast and Fly Protein-Protein 
Interaction Networks.

Proteins within a molecular network are expected to be subject to different 
selective pressures depending on their relative hierarchical positions. However, 
it is not obvious what genes within a network should be more likely to evolve 
under positive selection. On one hand, only mutations at genes with a relatively 
high degree of control over adaptive phenotypes (such as those encoding highly 
connected proteins) are expected to be "seen" by natural selection. On the other 
hand, a high degree of pleiotropy at these genes is expected to hinder 
adaptation. Previous analyses of the human protein-protein interaction network 
have shown that genes under long-term, recurrent positive selection (as inferred 
from interspecific comparisons) tend to act at the periphery of the network. It 
is unknown, however, whether these trends apply to other organisms. Here, we 
show that long-term positive selection has preferentially targeted the periphery 
of the yeast interactome. Conversely, in flies, genes under positive selection 
encode significantly more connected and central proteins. These observations are 
not due to covariation of genes' adaptability and centrality with confounding 
factors. Therefore, the distribution of proteins encoded by genes under 
recurrent positive selection across protein-protein interaction networks varies 
from one species to another.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins are overexpressed in multiple diseases, 
including cancer, and have emerged as anticancer drug targets. HDAC proteins 
regulate cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell 
proliferation, by deacetylating histone and non-histone substrates. Although a 
plethora of acetylated proteins have been identified using large-scale proteomic 
approaches, the HDAC proteins responsible for their dynamic deacetylation have 
been poorly studied. For example, few substrates of HDAC1 have been identified, 
which is mainly due to the scarcity of substrate identification tools. We 
recently developed a mutant trapping strategy to identify novel substrates of 
HDAC1. Herein, we introduce an improved version of the trapping method that uses 
mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to identify multiple substrates 
simultaneously. Among the substrate hits, CDK1, AIFM1, MSH6, and RuvB-like 1 
were identified as likely HDAC1 substrates. These newly discovered HDAC1 
substrates are involved in various biological processes, suggesting novel 
functions of HDAC1 apart from epigenetics. Substrate trapping combined with 
MS-based proteomics provides an efficient approach to HDAC1 substrate 
identification and contributes to the full characterization of HDAC function in 
normal and disease states.

We present an RNA-Seq based approach to map 3' end sequences of mature 16S rRNA 
(3' TAIL) in bacteria with single-base specificity. Our results show that 3' 
TAILs are heterogeneous among species; they contain the core CCUCC 
anti-Shine-Dalgarno motif, but vary in downstream lengths. Importantly, our 
findings rectify the mis-annotated 16S rRNAs in 11 out of 13 bacterial species 
studied herein (covering Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, and Spirochaetes). Furthermore, our results show 
that species-specific 3' TAIL boundaries are retained due to their high 
complementarity with preferred Shine-Dalgarno sequences, suggesting that 3' TAIL 
bases downstream of the canonical CCUCC motif play a more important role in 
translation initiation than previously reported.

The assembly of small disordered proteins into highly ordered amyloid fibrils in 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients is closely associated with dementia and 
neurodegeneration. Understanding the process of amyloid formation is thus 
crucial in the development of effective treatments for these devastating 
neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, a tiny, highly conserved and disordered 
protein called SERF was discovered to modify amyloid formation in Caenorhabditis 
elegans and humans. Here, we use kinetics measurements and native ion 
mobility-mass spectrometry to show that SERF mainly affects the rate of primary 
nucleation in amyloid formation for the disease-related proteins Aβ40 and 
α-synuclein. SERF's high degree of plasticity enables it to bind various 
conformations of monomeric Aβ40 and α-synuclein to form structurally diverse, 
fuzzy complexes. This structural diversity persists into early stages of amyloid 
formation. Our results suggest that amyloid nucleation is considerably more 
complex than age-related conversion of Aβ40 and α-synuclein into single 
amyloid-prone conformations.

Friedreich ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease with an autosomal recessive 
inheritance. In most patients, the disease is caused by the presence of 
trinucleotide GAA expansions in the first intron of the frataxin gene. These 
expansions cause the decreased expression of this mitochondrial protein. Many 
evidences indicate that frataxin deficiency causes the deregulation of cellular 
iron homeostasis. In this review, we will discuss several hypotheses proposed 
for frataxin function, their caveats, and how they could provide an explanation 
for the deregulation of iron homeostasis found in frataxin-deficient cells. We 
will also focus on the potential mechanisms causing cellular dysfunction in 
Friedreich Ataxia and on the potential use of the iron chelator deferiprone as a 
therapeutic agent for this disease.

Functional compensation of mouse duplicates by their paralogs expressed in the 
same tissues.

Jersey, Piscataway, NJ, 08854, USA.

Analyses in a number of organisms have shown that duplicated genes are less 
likely to be essential than singletons. This implies that genes can often 
compensate for the loss of their paralogs. However, it is unclear why the loss 
of some duplicates can be compensated by their paralogs, whereas the loss of 
other duplicates cannot. Surprisingly, initial analyses in mice did not detect 
differences in the essentiality of duplicates and singletons. Only subsequent 
analyses, using larger gene knockout datasets and controlling for a number of 
confounding factors, did detect significant differences. Previous studies have 
not taken into account the tissues in which duplicates are expressed. We 
hypothesized that in complex organisms, in order for a gene's loss to be 
compensated by one or more of its paralogs, such paralogs need to be expressed 
in at least the same set of tissues as the lost gene. To test our hypothesis, we 
classified mouse duplicates into two categories based on the expression patterns 
of their paralogs: "compensable duplicates" (those with paralogs expressed in 
all the tissues in which the gene is expressed) and "non-compensable duplicates" 
(those whose paralogs are not expressed in all the tissues where the gene is 
expressed). In agreement with our hypothesis, the essentiality of 
non-compensable duplicates is similar to that of singletons, whereas compensable 
duplicates exhibit a substantially lower essentiality. Our results imply that 
duplicates can often compensate for the loss of their paralogs, but only if they 
are expressed in the same tissues. Indeed, the compensation ability is more 
dependent on expression patterns than on protein sequence similarity. The 
existence of these two kinds of duplicates with different essentialities, which 
has been overlooked by prior studies, may have hindered the detection of 
differences between singletons and duplicates.

Identification of common highly expressed genes of Salmonella Enteritidis by in

Chickens are the reservoir host of Salmonella Enteritidis. Salmonella 
Enteritidis colonizes the gastro-intestinal tract of chickens and replicates 
within macrophages without causing clinically discernable illness. Persistence 
of S. Enteritidis in the hostile environments of intestinal tract and 
macrophages allows it to disseminate extra-intestinally to liver, spleen, and 
reproductive tract. Extra-intestinal dissemination into reproductive tract leads 
to contamination of internal contents of eggs, which is a major risk factor for 
human infection. Understanding the genes that contribute to S. Enteritidis 
persistence in the chicken host is central to elucidate the genetic basis of the 
unique pathobiology of this public health pathogen. The aim of this study was to 
identify a succinct set of genes associated with infection-relevant in vitro 
environments to provide a rational foundation for subsequent 
biologically-relevant research. We used in silico prediction of gene expression 
and RNA-seq technology to identify a core set of 73 S. Enteritidis genes that 
are consistently highly expressed in multiple S. Enteritidis strains cultured at 
avian physiologic temperature under conditions that represent intestinal and 
intracellular environments. These common highly expressed (CHX) genes encode 
proteins involved in bacterial metabolism, protein synthesis, cell-envelope 
biogenesis, stress response, and a few proteins with uncharacterized functions. 
Further studies are needed to dissect the contribution of these CHX genes to the 
pathobiology of S. Enteritidis in the avian host. Several of the CHX genes could 
serve as promising targets for studies towards the development of 
immunoprophylactic and novel therapeutic strategies to prevent colonization of 
chickens and their environment with S. Enteritidis.

Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] 1 (SOD1), is an antioxidant enzyme encoded by the 
gene SOD1, responsible for regulating oxidative stress levels by sequestering 
free radicals. Identified as the first gene with mutations in Amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), SOD1 is a determinant for studying diseases of aging 
and neurodegeneration. With guidance on well-characterized anti-SOD1 antibodies, 
the reproducibility of SOD1 research would be enhanced. In this study, we 
characterized eleven SOD1 commercial antibodies for Western blot, 
immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental 
protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic 
parental controls. We identified many high-performing antibodies and encourage 
readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody 
for their specific needs.

Since the advent of cetuximab, clinical cancer treatment has evolved from the 
standard, relatively nonspecific chemo- and radiotherapy with significant 
cytotoxic side effects towards immunotherapeutic approaches with selective, 
target-mechanism-based effects. Antibody therapies as the most successful form 
of cancer immunotherapy led to approved treatments for specific cancer types 
with increased patient survival. Thus, the identification of tumor antigens with 
high immunogenicity is in central focus now. In this study, we applied 
computational methods to comprehensively discover overexpressed molecular 
targets with high therapeutic relevance for clinical, immunotherapeutic cancer 
treatment in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). By actively modeling 
potential negative side effects utilizing expression data of 29 different, 
normal human tissues, we were able to develop a highly-specific coverage of TNBC 
patients with RNA targets. We identified here more than 400 potential 
tumor-specific antigens suitable for targeted therapy, including several already 
identified as potential targets for TNBC and other solid tumors. A specific 
cocktail of MAGEB4, CT83, TLX3, ACTL8, PRDM13 achieved almost 94% patient 
coverage in TNBC. Overall, these results show that our approach can identify and 
prioritize TNBC targets suitable for targeted therapy. Therefore, our method has 
the potential to lead to new and more effective immunotherapeutic cancer 
treatment.

Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in numerous complex diseases. 
Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the "powerhouse of the cell" 
turns into the "factory of death" is an exciting yet challenging task that can 
unveil new therapeutic targets. The mitochondrial matrix protein CyPD is a 
peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase involved in the regulation of the 
permeability transition pore (mPTP). The mPTP is a multi-conductance channel in 
the inner mitochondrial membrane whose dysregulated opening can ultimately lead 
to cell death and whose involvement in pathology has been extensively documented 
over the past few decades. Moreover, several mPTP-independent CyPD interactions 
have been identified, indicating that CyPD could be involved in the fine 
regulation of several biochemical pathways. To further enrich the picture, CyPD 
undergoes several post-translational modifications that regulate both its 
activity and interaction with its clients. Here, we will dissect what is 
currently known about CyPD and critically review the most recent literature 
about its involvement in neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on Alzheimer's 
Disease and Parkinson's Disease, supporting the notion that CyPD could serve as 
a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of such conditions. Notably, 
significant efforts have been made to develop CyPD-specific inhibitors, which 
hold promise for the treatment of such complex disorders.

MCL-1 is a BCL-2 family protein implicated in the development and 
chemoresistance of human cancer. Unlike its anti-apoptotic homologs, Mcl-1 
deletion has profound physiologic consequences, indicative of a broader role in 
homeostasis. We report that the BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) α helix of MCL-1 can 
directly engage very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), a key enzyme of 
the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) pathway. Proteomic analysis 
confirmed that the mitochondrial matrix isoform of MCL-1 (MCL-1Matrix) interacts 
with VLCAD. Mcl-1 deletion, or eliminating MCL-1Matrix alone, selectively 
deregulated long-chain FAO, causing increased flux through the pathway in 
response to nutrient deprivation. Transient elevation in MCL-1 upon serum 
withdrawal, a striking increase in MCL-1 BH3/VLCAD interaction upon palmitic 
acid titration, and direct modulation of enzymatic activity by the MCL-1 BH3 α 
helix are consistent with dynamic regulation. Thus, the MCL-1 BH3 interaction 
with VLCAD revealed a separable, gain-of-function role for MCL-1 in the

BACKGROUND: Genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) is a powerful tool for the study 
of cellular metabolic characteristics. With the development of multi-omics 
measurement techniques in recent years, new methods that integrating multi-omics 
data into the GSMM show promising effects on the predicted results. It does not 
only improve the accuracy of phenotype prediction but also enhances the 
reliability of the model for simulating complex biochemical phenomena, which can 
promote theoretical breakthroughs for specific gene target identification or 
better understanding the cell metabolism on the system level.
RESULTS: Based on the basic GSMM model iHL1210 of Aspergillus niger, we 
integrated large-scale enzyme kinetics and proteomics data to establish a GSMM 
based on enzyme constraints, termed a GEM with Enzymatic Constraints using 
Kinetic and Omics data (GECKO). The results show that enzyme constraints 
effectively improve the model's phenotype prediction ability, and extended the 
model's potential to guide target gene identification through predicting 
metabolic phenotype changes of A. niger by simulating gene knockout. In 
addition, enzyme constraints significantly reduced the solution space of the 
model, i.e., flux variability over 40.10% metabolic reactions were significantly 
reduced. The new model showed also versatility in other aspects, like estimating 
large-scale [Formula: see text] values, predicting the differential expression 
of enzymes under different growth conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that incorporating enzymes' abundance information 
into GSMM is very effective for improving model performance with A. niger. 
Enzyme-constrained model can be used as a powerful tool for predicting the 
metabolic phenotype of A. niger by incorporating proteome data. In the 
foreseeable future, with the fast development of measurement techniques, and 
more precise and rich proteomics quantitative data being obtained for A. niger, 
the enzyme-constrained GSMM model will show greater application space on the 
system level.

IID (Integrated Interactions Database) is the first database providing 
tissue-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) for model organisms and 
human. IID covers six species (S. cerevisiae (yeast), C. elegans (worm), D. 
melonogaster (fly), R. norvegicus (rat), M. musculus (mouse) and H. sapiens 
(human)) and up to 30 tissues per species. Users query IID by providing a set of 
proteins or PPIs from any of these organisms, and specifying species and tissues 
where IID should search for interactions. If query proteins are not from the 
selected species, IID enables searches across species and tissues automatically 
by using their orthologs; for example, retrieving interactions in a given 
tissue, conserved in human and mouse. Interaction data in IID comprises three 
types of PPI networks: experimentally detected PPIs from major databases, 
orthologous PPIs and high-confidence computationally predicted PPIs. 
Interactions are assigned to tissues where their proteins pairs or encoding 
genes are expressed. IID is a major replacement of the I2D interaction database, 
with larger PPI networks (a total of 1,566,043 PPIs among 68,831 proteins), 
tissue annotations for interactions, and new query, analysis and data 
visualization capabilities. IID is available at http://ophid.utoronto.ca/iid.

The FtsZ protein is a central component of the bacterial cell division 
machinery. It polymerizes at mid-cell and recruits more than 30 proteins to 
assemble into a macromolecular complex to direct cell wall constriction. FtsZ 
polymers exhibit treadmilling dynamics, driving the processive movement of 
enzymes that synthesize septal peptidoglycan (sPG). Here, we combine theoretical 
modelling with single-molecule imaging of live bacterial cells to show that 
FtsZ's treadmilling drives the directional movement of sPG enzymes via a 
Brownian ratchet mechanism. The processivity of the directional movement depends 
on the binding potential between FtsZ and the sPG enzyme, and on a balance 
between the enzyme's diffusion and FtsZ's treadmilling speed. We propose that 
this interplay may provide a mechanism to control the spatiotemporal 
distribution of active sPG enzymes, explaining the distinct roles of FtsZ 
treadmilling in modulating cell wall constriction rate observed in different 
bacteria.

How changes in the different steps of protein synthesis-transcription, 
translation and degradation-contribute to differences of protein abundance among 
genes is not fully understood. There is however accumulating evidence that 
transcriptional divergence might have a prominent role. Here, we show that yeast 
paralogous genes are more divergent in transcription than in translation. We 
explore two causal mechanisms for this predominance of transcriptional 
divergence: an evolutionary trade-off between the precision and economy of gene 
expression and a larger mutational target size for transcription. Performing 
simulations within a minimal model of post-duplication evolution, we find that 
both mechanisms are consistent with the observed divergence patterns. We also 
investigate how additional properties of the effects of mutations on gene 
expression, such as their asymmetry and correlation across levels of regulation, 
can shape the evolution of paralogs. Our results highlight the importance of 
fully characterizing the distributions of mutational effects on transcription 
and translation. They also show how general trade-offs in cellular processes and 
mutation bias can have far-reaching evolutionary impacts.

RNA-binding protein Fused-in Sarcoma (FUS) plays an essential role in various 
cellular processes. Mutations in the C-terminal domain region, where the nuclear 
localization signal (NLS) is located, causes the redistribution of FUS from the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm. In neurons, neurotoxic aggregates are formed as a 
result, contributing to neurogenerative diseases. Well-characterized anti-FUS 
antibodies would enable the reproducibility of FUS research, thereby benefiting 
the scientific community.  In this study, we characterized ten FUS commercial 
antibodies for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a 
standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell 
lines and isogenic parental controls. We identified many high-performing 
antibodies and encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the 
most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

Characterizing shared patterns of RNA expression between genes across conditions 
has led to the discovery of regulatory networks and biological functions. 
However, it is unclear if such coordination extends to translation. In this 
study, we uniformly analyze 3,819 ribosome profiling datasets from 117 human and 
94 mouse tissues and cell lines. We introduce the concept of translation 
efficiency covariation (TEC), identifying coordinated translation patterns 
across cell types. We nominate candidate mechanisms driving shared patterns of 
translation regulation. TEC is conserved across human and mouse cells and 
uncovers gene functions that are not evident from RNA or protein co-expression. 
Moreover, our observations indicate that proteins that physically interact are 
highly enriched for positive covariation at both translational and 
transcriptional levels. Our findings establish TEC as a conserved organizing 
principle of mammalian transcriptomes. TEC has potential as a predictive marker 
for gene function and may offer a framework for designing gene expression 
systems in synthetic biology and biotechnological applications.

The combination of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the pET expression system is 
used extensively for the expression of various recombinant proteins (RPs). 
However, RP overexpression often introduces a growth burden for the host, 
especially in the case of toxic proteins. The key to solving this problem is to 
reduce the host burden associated with protein overproduction, which is often 
achieved by regulating the expression or activity of T7 RNAP or growth-decoupled 
systems. However, these strategies mainly relieve or interrupt the robbing of 
host resources, and do not eliminate other types of host burdens in the 
production process. In this study, we constructed a production system based on a 
dynamic equilibrium to precisely relieve the host burden and increase the RP 
production. The system is composed of three modules, including the 
overexpression of basic growth-related genes (rRNA, RNAP core enzyme, sigma 
factors), prediction and overexpression of key proteins using the 
enzyme-constrained model ec_iECBD_1354, and dynamic regulation of growth-related 
and key protein expression intensity based on a burden-driven promoter. Using 
this system, the production of many high-burden proteins, including autolysis 
protein and E. coli membrane proteins, was increased to varying degrees. Among 
them, the cytosine transporter protein (CodB) was most significantly improved, 
with a 4.02-fold higher production compared to the wild strain. This system can 
effectively reduce the optimizing costs, and is suitable for developing various 
types of RP expression hosts rapidly. KEY POINTS: • The basic growth-related 
resources can relieve the host burden from recombinant protein. • The 
enzyme-constrained model can accurately predict key genes to improve yield. • 
The expression intensity can be dynamically adjusted with changes in burden.

Tromsø-The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway.

NBR1 was discovered as an autophagy receptor not long after the first described 
vertebrate autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1. Since then, p62 has currently been 
mentioned in >10,000 papers on PubMed, while NBR1 is mentioned in <350 papers. 
Nonetheless, evolutionary analysis reveals that NBR1, and likely also selective 
autophagy, was present already in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), 
while p62 appears first in the early Metazoan lineage. Furthermore, 
yeast-selective autophagy receptors Atg19 and Atg34 represent NBR1 homologs. 
NBR1 is the main autophagy receptor in plants that do not contain p62, while 
most animal taxa contain both NBR1 and p62. Mechanistic studies are starting to 
shed light on the collaboration between mammalian NBR1 and p62 in the autophagic 
degradation of protein aggregates (aggrephagy). Several domains of NBR1 are 
involved in cargo recognition, and the list of known substrates for 
NBR1-mediated selective autophagy is increasing. Lastly, roles of NBR1 in human 
diseases such as proteinopathies and cancer are emerging.

The Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping enzyme and the decapping activators Pat1, Dhh1, and Lsm1 
regulate mRNA decapping, but their mechanistic integration is unknown. We 
analyzed the gene expression consequences of deleting PAT1, LSM1, or DHH1, or 
the DCP2 C-terminal domain, and found that: i) the Dcp2 C-terminal domain is an 
effector of both negative and positive regulation; ii) rather than being global 
activators of decapping, Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 directly target specific subsets 
of yeast mRNAs and loss of the functions of each of these factors has 
substantial indirect consequences for genome-wide mRNA expression; and iii) 
transcripts targeted by Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 exhibit only partial overlap, are 
generally translated inefficiently, and, as expected, are targeted to 
decapping-dependent decay. Our results define the roles of Pat1, Lsm1, and Dhh1 
in decapping of general mRNAs and suggest that these factors may monitor mRNA 
translation and target unique features of individual mRNAs.

The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence motif facilitates translation initiation and is 
frequently found upstream of bacterial start codons. However, thousands of 
instances of this motif occur throughout the middle of protein coding genes in a 
typical bacterial genome. Here, we use comparative evolutionary analysis to test 
whether SD sequences located within genes are functionally constrained. We 
measure the conservation of SD sequences across Enterobacteriales, and find that 
they are significantly less conserved than expected. Further, the strongest SD 
sequences are the least conserved whereas we find evidence of conservation for 
the weakest possible SD sequences given amino acid constraints. Our findings 
indicate that most SD sequences within genes are likely to be deleterious and 
removed via selection. To illustrate the origin of these deleterious costs, we 
show that ATG start codons are significantly depleted downstream of SD sequences 
within genes, highlighting the constraint that these sequences impose on the 
surrounding nucleotides to minimize the potential for erroneous translation 
initiation.

MOTIVATION: The advance of mass spectrometry-based technologies enabled the 
profiling of the phosphoproteomes of a multitude of cell and tissue types. 
However, current research primarily focused on investigating the phosphorylation 
dynamics in specific cell types and experimental conditions, whereas the 
phosphorylation events that are common across cell/tissue types and stable 
regardless of experimental conditions are, so far, mostly ignored.
RESULTS: Here, we developed a statistical framework to identify the stable 
phosphoproteome across 53 human phosphoproteomics datasets, covering 40 
cell/tissue types and 194 conditions/treatments. We demonstrate that the stably 
phosphorylated sites (SPSs) identified from our statistical framework are 
evolutionarily conserved, functionally important and enriched in a range of core 
signaling and gene pathways. Particularly, we show that SPSs are highly enriched 
in the RNA splicing pathway, an essential cellular process in mammalian cells, 
and frequently disrupted by cancer mutations, suggesting a link between the 
dysregulation of RNA splicing and cancer development through mutations on SPSs.

BACKGROUND: Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a serine/threonine 
kinase, which regulates programmed cell death and inflammation. Recently, the 
involvement of RIPK1 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been 
reported; RIPK1 is involved in microglia's phenotypic transition to their 
dysfunctional states, and it is highly expressed in the neurons and microglia in 
the postmortem brains in AD patients. They prompt neurodegeneration leading to 
accumulations of pathological proteins in AD. Therefore, regulation of RIPK1 
could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD, and in vivo 
imaging of RIPK1 may become a useful modality in studies of drug discovery and 
pathophysiology of AD. The purpose of this study was to develop a suitable 
radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of RIPK1.
RESULTS: (S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one 
(GSK'963) has a high affinity, selectivity for RIPK1, and favorable 
physiochemical properties based on its chemical structure. In this study, since 
11C-labeling (half-life: 20.4 min) GSK'963 retaining its structure requiring the 
Grignard reaction of tert-butylmagnesium halides and [11C]carbon dioxide was 
anticipated to give a low yield, we decided instead to 11C-label a GSK'963 
analog 
((S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-(m-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one, 
GG502), which has a high RIPK1 inhibitory activity equivalent to that of the 
original compound GSK'963. Thus, we successfully 11C-labeled GG502 using a 
Pd-mediated cross-coupling reaction in favorable yields (3.6 ± 1.9%) and 
radiochemical purities (> 96%), and molar activity (47-115 GBq/μmol). On 
autoradiography, radioactivity accumulation was observed for [11C]GG502 and 
decreased by non-radioactive GG502 in the mouse spleen and human brain, 
indicating the possibility of specific binding of this ligand to RIPK1. On brain 
PET imaging in a rhesus monkey, [11C]GG502 showed a good brain permeability 
(peak standardized uptake value (SUV) ~3.0), although there was no clear 
evidence of specific binding of [11C]GG502. On brain PET imaging in acute 
inflammation model rats, [11C]GG502 also showed a good brain permeability, and 
no significant increased uptake was observed in the lipopolysaccharide-treated 
side of striatum. On metabolite analysis in rats at 30 min after administration 
of [11C]GG502, ~55% and ~10% of radioactivity was from unmetabolized [11C]GG502 
in the brain and the plasma, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We synthesized and evaluated a 11C-labeled PET ligand based on the 
methylated analog of GSK'963 for imaging of RIPK1 in the brain. Although in 
autoradiography of the resulting [11C]GG502 indicated the possibility of 
specific binding, the actual PET imaging failed to detect any evidence of 
specific binding to RIPK1 despite its good brain permeability. Further 
development of radioligands with a higher binding affinity for RIPK1 in vivo and 
more stable metabolite profiles compared with the current compound may be 
required.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an essential matrix for the discovery of 
neurological disease biomarkers. However, the high dynamic range of protein 
concentrations in CSF hinders the detection of the least abundant protein 
biomarkers by untargeted mass spectrometry. It is thus beneficial to gain a 
deeper understanding of the secretion processes within the brain. Here, we aim 
to explore if and how the secretion of brain proteins to the CSF can be 
predicted. By combining a curated CSF proteome and the brain elevated proteome 
of the Human Protein Atlas, brain proteins were classified as CSF or non-CSF 
secreted. A machine learning model was trained on a range of sequence-based 
features to differentiate between CSF and non-CSF groups and effectively predict 
the brain origin of proteins. The classification model achieves an area under 
the curve of 0.89 if using high confidence CSF proteins. The most important 
prediction features include the subcellular localization, signal peptides, and 
transmembrane regions. The classifier generalized well to the larger brain 
detected proteome and is able to correctly predict novel CSF proteins identified 
by affinity proteomics. In addition to elucidating the underlying mechanisms of 
protein secretion, the trained classification model can support biomarker 
candidate selection.

Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) are enriched for certain "motifs." 
Motif usage is commonly interpreted in adaptationist terms, i.e., that the 
optimal motif evolves. But certain motifs can also evolve more easily than 
others. Here, we computationally evolved TRNs to produce a pulse of an effector 
protein. Two well-known motifs, type 1 incoherent feed-forward loops (I1FFLs) 
and negative feedback loops (NFBLs), evolved as the primary solutions. The 
relative rates at which these two motifs evolve depend on selection conditions, 
but under all conditions, either motif achieves similar performance. I1FFLs 
generally evolve more often than NFBLs. Selection for a tall pulse favors NFBLs, 
while selection for a fast response favors I1FFLs. I1FFLs are more 
evolutionarily accessible early on, before the effector protein evolves high 
expression; when NFBLs subsequently evolve, they tend to do so from a conjugated 
I1FFL-NFBL genotype. In the empirical S. cerevisiae TRN, output genes of NFBLs 
had higher expression levels than those of I1FFLs. These results suggest that 
evolutionary accessibility, and not relative functionality, shapes which motifs 
evolve in TRNs, and does so as a function of the expression levels of particular 
genes.

Cancer cachexia is a complex metabolic disorder accounting for ~20% of 
cancer-related deaths, yet its metabolic landscape remains unexplored. Here, we 
report a decrease in B vitamin-related liver enzymes as a hallmark of systemic 
metabolic changes occurring in cancer cachexia. Metabolomics of multiple mouse 
models highlights cachexia-associated reductions of niacin, vitamin B6, and a 
glycine-related subset of one-carbon (C1) metabolites in the liver. Integration 
of proteomics and metabolomics reveals that liver enzymes related to niacin, 
vitamin B6, and glycine-related C1 enzymes dependent on B vitamins decrease 
linearly with their associated metabolites, likely reflecting stoichiometric 
cofactor-enzyme interactions. The decrease of B vitamin-related enzymes is also 
found to depend on protein abundance and cofactor subtype. These 
metabolic/proteomic changes and decreased protein malonylation, another cachexia 
feature identified by protein post-translational modification analysis, are 
reflected in blood samples from mouse models and gastric cancer patients with 
cachexia, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings.

The pancreas is a vital organ with digestive and endocrine roles, and diseases 
of the pancreas affect millions of people yearly. A better understanding of the 
pancreas proteome and its dynamic post-translational modifications (PTMs) is 
necessary to engineer higher fidelity tissue analogues for use in 
transplantation. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has major roles in binding and 
signaling essential to the viability of insulin-producing islets of Langerhans. 
To characterize PTMs in the pancreas, native and decellularized tissues from 
four donors were analyzed. N-Glycosylated and phosphorylated peptides were 
simultaneously enriched via electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction 
chromatography and analyzed with mass spectrometry, maximizing PTM information 
from one workflow. A modified surfactant and chaotropic agent assisted 
sequential extraction/on-pellet digestion was used to maximize solubility of the 
ECM. The analysis resulted in the confident identification of 3650 proteins, 
including 517 N-glycoproteins and 148 phosphoproteins. We identified 214 ECM 
proteins, of which 99 were N-glycosylated, 18 were phosphorylated, and 9 were 
found to have both modifications. Collagens, a major component of the ECM, were 
the most highly glycosylated of the ECM proteins and several were also heavily 
phosphorylated, raising the possibility of structural and thus functional 
changes resulting from these modifications. To our knowledge, this work 
represents the first characterization of PTMs in pancreatic ECM proteins. This 
work provides a basal profile of PTMs in the healthy human pancreatic ECM, 
laying the foundation for future investigations to determine disease-specific 
changes such as in diabetes and pancreatic cancer, and potentially helping to 
guide the development of tissue replacement constructs. Data are available via 
ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025048.

In a global effort for scientific transparency, it has become feasible and good 
practice to share experimental data supporting novel findings. Consequently, the 
amount of publicly available MS-based proteomics data has grown substantially in 
recent years. With some notable exceptions, this extensive material has however 
largely been left untouched. The time has now come for the proteomics community 
to utilize this potential gold mine for new discoveries, and uncover its 
untapped potential. In this review, we provide a brief history of the sharing of 
proteomics data, showing ways in which publicly available proteomics data are 
already being (re-)used, and outline potential future opportunities based on 
four different usage types: use, reuse, reprocess, and repurpose. We thus aim to 
assist the proteomics community in stepping up to the challenge, and to make the 
most of the rapidly increasing amount of public proteomics data.

Cytokines and chemokines have diverse and pleiotropic functions in peripheral 
tissues and in the brain. Recent studies uncovered a novel family of 
neuron-derived secretory proteins, or neurokines, distantly related to 
chemokines. The FAM19A family comprises five ∼12-15 kDa secretory proteins 
(FAM19A1-5), also known as TAFA1-5, that are predominantly detected in the 
central and peripheral nervous system. FAM19A expression in the central nervous 
system is dynamically regulated during development and in the postnatal brain. 
As secreted ligands, FAM19A proteins appear to bind to different classes of cell 
surface receptors (e.g., GPCRs and neurexins). Functional studies using gain- 
and loss-of-function mouse models established nonredundant roles for each FAM19A 
family member in regulating diverse physiological processes ranging from 
locomotor activity and food intake to learning and memory, anxiety- and 
depressive-like behaviors, social communication, repetitive behaviors, and 
somatosensory functions. This review summarizes major advances as well as the 
limitations and knowledge gaps in understanding the regulation and diverse 
biological functions of this conserved family of neurokines.

The biomass equation is a critical component in genome-scale metabolic models 
(GEMs): it is used as the de facto objective function in flux balance analysis 
(FBA). This equation accounts for the quantities of all known biomass precursors 
that are required for cell growth based on the macromolecular and monomer 
compositions measured at certain conditions. However, it is often reported that 
the macromolecular composition of cells could change across different 
environmental conditions and thus the use of the same single biomass equation in 
FBA, under multiple conditions, is questionable. Herein, we first investigated 
the qualitative and quantitative variations of macromolecular compositions of 
three representative host organisms, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
and Cricetulus griseus, across different environmental/genetic variations. While 
macromolecular building blocks such as RNA, protein, and lipid composition vary 
notably, changes in fundamental biomass monomer units such as nucleotides and 
amino acids are not appreciable. We also observed that flux predictions through 
FBA is quite sensitive to macromolecular compositions but not the monomer 
compositions. Based on these observations, we propose ensemble representations 
of biomass equation in FBA to account for the natural variation of cellular 
constituents. Such ensemble representations of biomass better predicted the flux 
through anabolic reactions as it allows for the flexibility in the biosynthetic 
demands of the cells. The current study clearly highlights that certain 
component of the biomass equation indeed vary across different conditions, and 
the ensemble representation of biomass equation in FBA by accounting for such 
natural variations could avoid inaccuracies that may arise from in silico 
simulations.

Growing cells increase multiple biosynthetic processes in response to the high 
metabolic demands needed to sustain proliferation. The even higher metabolic 
requirements in the setting of cancer provoke proportionately greater 
biosynthesis. Underappreciated key aspects of this increased metabolic demand 
are guanine nucleotides and adaptive mechanisms to regulate their concentration. 
Using the malignant brain tumour, glioblastoma, as a model, we have demonstrated 
that one of the rate-limiting enzymes for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) 
synthesis, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase-2 (IMPDH2), is increased and 
IMPDH2 expression is necessary for the activation of de novo GTP biosynthesis. 
Moreover, increased IMPDH2 enhances RNA polymerase I and III transcription 
directly linking GTP metabolism to both anabolic capacity as well as nucleolar 
enlargement historically observed as associated with cancer. In this review, we 
will review in detail the basis of these new discoveries and, more generally, 
summarize the current knowledge on the role of GTP metabolism in cancer.

The novel SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global challenge on healthcare 
and society. For understanding the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the 
cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary. 
The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is angiotensin I 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we report the expression pattern of ACE2 
across > 150 different cell types corresponding to all major human tissues and 
organs based on stringent immunohistochemical analysis. The results were 
compared with several datasets both on the mRNA and protein level. ACE2 
expression was mainly observed in enterocytes, renal tubules, gallbladder, 
cardiomyocytes, male reproductive cells, placental trophoblasts, ductal cells, 
eye, and vasculature. In the respiratory system, the expression was limited, 
with no or only low expression in a subset of cells in a few individuals, 
observed by one antibody only. Our data constitute an important resource for 
further studies on SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry, in order to understand the 
biology of the disease and to aid in the development of effective treatments to 
the viral infection.

Kinases and phosphatases are major players in a variety of cellular events, 
including cell signaling. Aberrant activity or mutations in kinases and 
phosphatases can lead to diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. 
Compared to kinases, phosphatases are understudied; this is partly a result of 
the limited methods for identifying substrates. As a solution, we developed a 
proteomics-based method called kinase-catalyzed biotinylation to identify 
phosphatase substrates (K-BIPS) that previously identified substrates of Ser/Thr 
phosphatases using small molecule inhibitors. Here, for the first time, K-BIPS 
was applied to identify substrates of a tyrosine phosphatase, protein tyrosine 
phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), under siRNA knockdown conditions. Eight possible 
substrates of PTP1B were discovered in HEK293 cells, including the known 
substrate pyruvate kinase. In addition, l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) was 
validated as a novel PTP1B substrate. With the ability to use knockdown 
conditions with Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphatases, K-BIPS represents a general 
discovery tool to explore phosphatases biology by identifying unanticipated 
substrates.

Protein abundance is crucial for the majority of genetically regulated cell 
functions to act properly in prokaryotic organisms. Therefore, developing 
bioinformatic methods for assessing the efficiency of different stages of gene 
expression is of great importance for predicting the actual protein abundance. 
One of these steps is the evaluation of translation elongation efficiency based 
on mRNA sequence features, such as codon usage bias and mRNA secondary structure 
properties. In this study, we have evaluated correlation coefficients between 
experimentally measured protein abundance and predicted elongation efficiency 
characteristics for 26 prokaryotes, including non-model organisms, belonging to 
diverse taxonomic groups The algorithm for assessing elongation efficiency takes 
into account not only codon bias, but also number and energy of secondary 
structures in mRNA if those demonstrate an impact on predicted elongation 
efficiency of the ribosomal protein genes. The results show that, for a number 
of organisms, secondary structures are a better predictor of protein abundance 
than codon usage bias. The bioinformatic analysis has revealed several factors 
associated with the value of the correlation coefficient. The first factor is 
the elongation efficiency optimization type-the organisms whose genomes are 
optimized for codon usage only have significantly higher correlation 
coefficients. The second factor is taxonomical identity-bacteria that belong to 
the class Bacilli tend to have higher correlation coefficients among the 
analyzed set. The third is growth rate, which is shown to be higher for the 
organisms with higher correlation coefficients between protein abundance and 
predicted translation elongation efficiency. The obtained results can be useful 
for further improvement of methods for protein abundance prediction.

In eukaryotes, disordered regions cover up to 50% of proteomes and mediate 
fundamental cellular processes. In contrast to globular domains, where about 
half of the amino acids are buried in the protein interior, disordered regions 
show higher solvent accessibility, which makes them prone to engage in 
non-functional interactions. Such interactions are exacerbated by the law of 
mass action, prompting the question of how they are minimized in abundant 
proteins. We find that interaction propensity or "stickiness" of disordered 
regions negatively correlates with their cellular abundance, both in yeast and 
human. Strikingly, considering yeast proteins where a large fraction of the 
sequence is disordered, the correlation between stickiness and abundance reaches 
R=-0.55. Beyond this global amino-acid composition bias, we identify three rules 
by which amino-acid composition of disordered regions adjusts with high 
abundance. First, lysines are preferred over arginines, consistent with the 
latter amino acid being stickier than the former. Second, compensatory effects 
exist, whereby a sticky region can be tolerated if it is compensated by a distal 
non-sticky region. Third, such compensation requires a lower average stickiness 
at the same abundance when compared to a scenario where stickiness is 
homogeneous throughout the sequence. We validate these rules experimentally, 
employing them as different strategies to rescue an otherwise sticky protein 
fragment from aggregation. Our results highlight that non-functional 
interactions represent a significant constraint in cellular systems and reveal 
simple rules by which protein sequences adapt to that constraint. Data from this

The 14-3-3 family proteins are vital scaffold proteins that ubiquitously 
expressed in various tissues. They interact with numerous protein targets and 
mediate many cellular signaling pathways. The 14-3-3 binding motifs are often 
embedded in intrinsically disordered regions which are closely associated with 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). In the past ten years, LLPS has been 
observed for a variety of proteins and biological processes, indicating that 
LLPS plays a fundamental role in the formation of membraneless organelles and 
cellular condensates. While extensive investigations have been performed on 
14-3-3 proteins, its involvement in LLPS is overlooked. To date, 14-3-3 proteins 
have not been reported to undergo LLPS alone or regulate LLPS of their binding 
partners. To reveal the potential involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in LLPS, in 
this review, we summarized the LLPS propensity of 14-3-3 binding partners and 
found that about one half of them may undergo LLPS spontaneously. We further 
analyzed the phase separation behavior of representative 14-3-3 binders and 
discussed how 14-3-3 proteins may be involved. By modulating the conformation 
and valence of interactions and recruiting other molecules, we speculate that 
14-3-3 proteins can efficiently regulate the functions of their targets in the 
context of LLPS. Considering the critical roles of 14-3-3 proteins, there is an 
urgent need for investigating the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in the phase 
separation process of their targets and the underling mechanisms.

Cationic intrinsically disordered antimicrobial peptides (CIDAMPs) belong to a 
novel class of epithelial peptide antibiotics with microbicidal activity against 
various pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, 
Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Here we show that treatment of 
distinct bacteria with different hornerin (HRNR)-derived CIDAMPs cause formation 
of unique cytoplasmic protein aggregates, suggesting a common intracellular mode 
of action. We further found that, unlike most amphipathic antimicrobial 
peptides, HRNR traverses bacterial membranes energy-dependently and accumulates 
within the cytoplasm. Strikingly, certain structurally different, HRNR-based 
CIDAMPs were found to bind to an identical panel of distinct bacterial ribosomal 
proteins, thereby manifesting features of several known classes of antibiotics. 
This may cause the formation of aberrant proteins and toxic protein aggregates 
in HRNR-treated pathogens which eventually may induce its death. Our study 
reveals evidence that structurally distinct CIDAMPs of an abundant body surface 
protein simultaneously target multiple sites of the bacterial protein synthesis 
machinery.

Protein Melting Temperature Cannot Fully Assess Whether Protein Folding Free 
Energy Underlies the Universal Abundance-Evolutionary Rate Correlation Seen in

The protein misfolding avoidance hypothesis explains the universal negative 
correlation between protein abundance and sequence evolutionary rate across the 
proteome by identifying protein folding free energy (ΔG) as the confounding 
variable. Abundant proteins resist toxic misfolding events by being more stable, 
and more stable proteins evolve slower because their mutations are more 
destabilizing. Direct supporting evidence consists only of computer simulations. 
A study taking advantage of a recent experimental breakthrough in measuring 
protein stability proteome-wide through melting temperature (Tm) (Leuenberger et 
al. 2017), found weak misfolding avoidance hypothesis support for the 
Escherichia coli proteome, and no support for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo 
sapiens, and Thermus thermophilus proteomes (Plata and Vitkup 2018). I find that 
the nontrivial relationship between Tm and ΔG and inaccuracy in Tm measurements 
by Leuenberger et al. 2017 can be responsible for not observing strong positive 
abundance-Tm and strong negative Tm-evolutionary rate correlations.

Increasing evidence shows that genetic interaction across the entire genome may 
explain a non-trivial fraction of genetic diseases. Digenic interaction is the 
simplest manifestation of genetic interaction among genes. However, systematic 
exploration of digenic interactive effects on the whole genome is often 
discouraged by the high dimension burden. Thus, numerous digenic interactions 
are yet to be identified for many diseases. Here, we propose a Digenic 
Interaction Effect Predictor (DIEP), an accurate machine-learning approach to 
identify the genome-wide pathogenic coding gene pairs with digenic interaction 
effects. This approach achieved high accuracy and sensitivity in independent 
testing datasets, outperforming another gene-level digenic predictor (DiGePred). 
DIEP was also able to discriminate digenic interaction effect from bi-locus 
effects dual molecular diagnosis (pseudo-digenic). Using DIEP, we provided a 
valuable resource of genome-wide digenic interactions and demonstrated the 
enrichment of the digenic interaction effect in Mendelian and Oligogenic 
diseases. Therefore, DIEP will play a useful role in facilitating the genomic 
mapping of interactive causal genes for human diseases.

The degree to which codon usage can be explained by tRNA abundance in bacterial 
species is often inadequate, partly because differential tRNA abundance is often 
approximated by tRNA copy numbers. To better understand the coevolution between 
tRNA abundance and codon usage, we provide a better estimate of tRNA abundance 
by profiling tRNA mapped reads (tRNA tpm) using publicly available RNA 
Sequencing data. To emphasize the feasibility of our approach, we demonstrate 
that tRNA tpm is consistent with tRNA abundances derived from RNA fingerprinting 
experiments in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella enterica. 
Furthermore, we do not observe an appreciable reduction in tRNA sequencing 
efficiency due to post-transcriptional methylations in the seven bacteria 
studied. To determine optimal codons, we calculate codon usage in highly and 
lowly expressed genes determined by protein per transcript. We found that tRNA 
tpm is sensitive to identify more translationally optimal codons than gene copy 
number and early tRNA fingerprinting abundances. Additionally, tRNA tpm improves 
the predictive power of tRNA adaptation index over codon preference. Our results 
suggest that dependence of codon usage on tRNA availability is not always 
associated with species growth-rate. Conversely, tRNA availability is better 
optimized to codon usage in fast-growing than slow-growing species.

The unequal utilization of synonymous codons affects numerous cellular processes 
including translation rates, protein folding and mRNA degradation. In order to 
understand the biological impact of variable codon usage bias (CUB) between 
genes and genomes, it is crucial to be able to accurately measure CUB for a 
given sequence. A large number of metrics have been developed for this purpose, 
but there is currently no way of systematically testing the accuracy of 
individual metrics or knowing whether metrics provide consistent results. This 
lack of standardization can result in false-positive and false-negative findings 
if underpowered or inaccurate metrics are applied as tools for discovery. Here, 
we show that the choice of CUB metric impacts both the significance and measured 
effect sizes in numerous empirical datasets, raising questions about the 
generality of findings in published research. To bring about standardization, we 
developed a novel method to create synthetic protein-coding DNA sequences 
according to different models of codon usage. We use these benchmark sequences 
to identify the most accurate and robust metrics with regard to sequence length, 
GC content and amino acid heterogeneity. Finally, we show how our benchmark can 
aid the development of new metrics by providing feedback on its performance 
compared to the state of the art.

The Lipocalin family is a group of homologous proteins characterized by its big 
array of functional capabilities. As extracellular proteins, they can bind small 
hydrophobic ligands through a well-conserved β-barrel folding. Lipocalins 
evolutionary history sprawls across many different taxa and shows great 
divergence even within chordates. This variability is also found in their 
heterogeneous tissue expression pattern. Although a handful of promoter regions 
have been previously described, studies on UTR regulatory roles in Lipocalin 
gene expression are scarce. Here we report a comprehensive bioinformatic 
analysis showing that complex post-transcriptional regulation exists in 
Lipocalin genes, as suggested by the presence of alternative UTRs with 
substantial sequence conservation in mammals, alongside a high diversity of 
transcription start sites and alternative promoters. Strong selective pressure 
could have operated upon Lipocalins UTRs, leading to an enrichment in particular 
sequence motifs that limit the choice of secondary structures. Mapping these 
regulatory features to the expression pattern of early and late diverging 
Lipocalins suggests that UTRs represent an additional phylogenetic signal, which 
may help to uncover how functional pleiotropy originated within the Lipocalin 
family.

Balance between asymmetry and abundance in multi-domain DNA-binding proteins may 
regulate the kinetics of their binding to DNA.

DNA sequences are often recognized by multi-domain proteins that may have higher 
affinity and specificity than single-domain proteins. However, the higher 
affinity to DNA might be coupled with slower recognition kinetics. In this 
study, we address this balance between stability and kinetics for multi-domain 
Cys2His2- (C2H2-) type zinc-finger (ZF) proteins. These proteins are the most 
prevalent DNA-binding domain in eukaryotes and C2H2 type zinc-finger proteins 
(C2H2-ZFPs) constitute nearly one-half of all known and predicted transcription 
factors in human. Extensive contact with DNA via tandem ZF domains confers high 
stability on the sequence-specific complexes. However, this can limit target 
search efficiency, especially for low abundance ZFPs. Earlier, we found that 
asymmetrical distribution of electrostatic charge among the three ZF domains of 
the low abundance transcription factor Egr-1 facilitates its DNA search process. 
Here, on a diverse set of 273 human C2H2-ZFP comprised of 3-15 tandem ZF 
domains, we find that, in many cases, electrostatic charge and binding 
specificity are asymmetrically distributed among the ZF domains so that 
neighbouring domains have different DNA-binding properties. For proteins 
containing 3-6 ZF domains, we show that the low abundance proteins possess a 
higher degree of non-specific asymmetry and vice versa. Our findings suggest 
that where the electrostatics of tandem ZF domains are similar (i.e., 
symmetrical), the ZFPs are more abundant to optimize their DNA search 
efficiency. This study reveals new insights into the fundamental determinants of 
recognition by C2H2-ZFPs of their DNA binding sites in the cellular landscape. 
The importance of electrostatic asymmetry with respect to binding site 
recognition by C2H2-ZFPs suggests the possibility that it may also be important 
in other ZFP systems and reveals a new design feature for zinc finger 
engineering.

While investigating peroxynitrite-dependent oxidation in murine RAW 264.7 
macrophage cells, we observed that removal of the Labile Iron Pool (LIP) by 
chelation increases the intracellular oxidation of the fluorescent indicator 
H2DCF, so we concluded that the LIP reacts with peroxynitrite and decreases the 
yield of peroxynitrite-derived oxidants. This was a paradigm-shifting finding in 
LIP biochemistry and raised many questions. In this follow-up study, we address 
fundamental properties of the interaction between the LIP and peroxynitrite by 
using the same cellular model and fluorescence methodology. We have identified 
that the reaction between the LIP and peroxynitrite has catalytic 
characteristics, and we have estimated that the rate constant of the reaction is 
in the range of 106 to 107 M-1s-1. Together, these observations suggest that the 
LIP represents a constitutive peroxynitrite reductase system in RAW 264.7 cells.

Yeast and cancer cells share the unusual characteristic of favoring fermentation 
of sugar over respiration. We now reveal an evolutionary conserved mechanism 
linking fermentation to activation of Ras, a major regulator of cell 
proliferation in yeast and mammalian cells, and prime proto-oncogene product. A 
yeast mutant (tps1∆) with overactive influx of glucose into glycolysis and 
hyperaccumulation of Fru1,6bisP, shows hyperactivation of Ras, which causes its 
glucose growth defect by triggering apoptosis. Fru1,6bisP is a potent activator 
of Ras in permeabilized yeast cells, likely acting through Cdc25. As in yeast, 
glucose triggers activation of Ras and its downstream targets MEK and ERK in 
mammalian cells. Biolayer interferometry measurements show that physiological 
concentrations of Fru1,6bisP stimulate dissociation of the pure Sos1/H-Ras 
complex. Thermal shift assay confirms direct binding to Sos1, the mammalian 
ortholog of Cdc25. Our results suggest that the Warburg effect creates a vicious 
cycle through Fru1,6bisP activation of Ras, by which enhanced fermentation 
stimulates oncogenic potency.Yeast and cancer cells both favor sugar 
fermentation in aerobic conditions. Here the authors describe a conserved 
mechanism from yeast to mammals where the glycolysis intermediate 
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate binds Cdc25/Sos1 and couples increased glycolytic flux 
to increased Ras proto-oncoprotein activity.

The global epidemic caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the infection of over 200 million 
people. To extend the knowledge of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and humans, 
we systematically investigate the interactome of 29 viral proteins in human 
cells by using an antibody-based TurboID assay. In total, 1,388 high-confidence 
human proximal proteins with biotinylated sites are identified. Notably, we find 
that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the antiviral and immune responses. We validate that 
the membrane protein ITGB1 associates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to 
mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibit 
activation of the interferon pathway through the mitochondrial protein 
mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and the methyltransferase SET 
domain containing 2, histone lysine methyltransferase (SETD2). We propose 111 
potential drugs for the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) and identify three compounds that significantly inhibit the 
replication of SARS-CoV-2. The proximity labeling map of SARS-CoV-2 and humans 
provides a resource for elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection and 
developing drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

Discovery of novel protein biomarkers for clinical applications is an active 
research field across a manifold of diseases. Despite some successes and 
progress, the biomarker development pipeline still frequently ends in failure. 
Biomarker candidates that are discovered by appropriate technologies such as 
unbiased mass spectrometry cannot be validated or translated to immunoassays in 
many cases. Selection of strong disease biomarker candidates that further 
constitute suitable targets for antibody binding in immunoassays is thus 
important to allow routine clinical use. This essential selection step can be 
supported and rationalized using bioinformatics tools such as protein databases. 
Here, we present a workflow in the form of decision trees to computationally 
investigate biomarker candidates and their available affinity reagents in depth. 
This analysis can identify the most promising biomarker candidates for assay 
development, while minimal time and effort are required.

Meiotic chromosome segregation relies on synapsis and crossover (CO) 
recombination between homologous chromosomes. These processes require multiple 
steps that are coordinated by the meiotic cell cycle and monitored by 
surveillance mechanisms. In diverse species, failures in chromosome synapsis can 
trigger a cell cycle delay and/or lead to apoptosis. How this key step in 
'homolog engagement' is sensed and transduced by meiotic cells is unknown. Here 
we report that in C. elegans, recruitment of the Polo-like kinase PLK-2 to the 
synaptonemal complex triggers phosphorylation and inactivation of CHK-2, an 
early meiotic kinase required for pairing, synapsis, and double-strand break 
(DSB) induction. Inactivation of CHK-2 terminates DSB formation and enables CO 
designation and cell cycle progression. These findings illuminate how meiotic 
cells ensure CO formation and accurate chromosome segregation.

Plain Language Summary: Most animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually, 
meaning that the genetic information from two parents combines during 
fertilization to produce offspring. This parental genetic information is carried 
within the reproductive cells in the form of chromosomes. Reproductive cells in 
the ovaries or testes first multiply through normal cell division, but then go 
through a unique type of cell division called meiosis. During meiosis, pairs of 
chromosomes – the two copies inherited from each parent – must find each other 
and physically line up from one end to the other. As they align side-by-side 
with their partners, chromosomes also go through a mixing process called 
recombination, during which regions of one chromosome cross over to the paired 
chromosome to exchange information. Scientists are still working to understand 
how this process of chromosome alignment and crossing-over is controlled. If 
chromosomes fail to line up or cross over during meiosis, eggs or sperm can end 
up with too many or too few chromosomes. If these faulty reproductive cells 
combine during fertilization this can lead to birth defects and developmental 
problems. To minimize this problem, reproductive cells have a quality control 
mechanism during meiosis called “crossover assurance”, which limits how often 
mistakes occur. Zhang et al. have investigated how cells can tell if their 
chromosomes have accomplished this as they undergo meiosis. They looked at egg 
cells of the roundworm C. elegans, whose meiotic processes are similar to those 
in humans. In C. elegans, a protein called CHK-2 regulates many of the early 
events during meiosis. During successful meiosis, CHK-2 is active for only a 
short amount of time. But if there are problems during recombination, CHK-2 
stays active for longer and prevents the cell division from proceeding. Zhang et 
al. uncovered another protein that affects for how long CHK-2 stays switched on. 
When chromosomes align with their partners, a protein called PLK-2 sticks to 
other proteins at the interface between the aligned chromosomes. A combination 
of microscopy and test tube experiments showed that when PLK-2 is bound to this 
specific location, it can turn off CHK-2. However, if the chromosome alignment 
fails, PLK-2 is not activated to switch off CHK-2. Therefore, CHK-2 is only 
switched off when the chromosomes are properly aligned and move on to the next 
step in crossing-over, which then allows meiosis to proceed. Thus, PLK-2 and 
CHK-2 work together to detect errors and to slow down meiosis if necessary. 
Further experiments in mammalian reproductive cells will reveal how similar the 
crossover assurance mechanism is in different organisms. In the future, improved 
understanding of quality control during meiosis may eventually lead to 
improvements in assisted reproduction.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), 
the leading cause of infectious disease-related deaths worldwide. TB infections 
present on a spectrum from active to latent disease. In the human host, Mtb 
faces hostile environments, such as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and low pH. 
Under these conditions, Mtb can enter a dormant, but viable, state characterized 
by a lack of cell replication and increased resistance to antibiotics. Dormant 
Mtb poses a major challenge to curing infections and eradicating TB globally. We 
subjected Mtb mc26020 (ΔlysA and ΔpanCD), a double auxotrophic strain, to carbon 
starvation (CS), a culture condition that induces growth stasis and mimics 
environmental conditions associated with dormancy in vivo. We provide a detailed 
analysis of the proteome in CS compared to replicating samples. We observed 
extensive proteomic reprogramming, with 36% of identified proteins significantly 
altered in CS. Many enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and lipid 
metabolism were retained or more abundant in CS. The cell wall biosynthetic 
machinery was present in CS, although numerous changes in the abundance of 
peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, and mycolic acid biosynthetic enzymes likely 
result in pronounced remodeling of the cell wall. Many clinically approved 
anti-TB drugs target cell wall biosynthesis, and we found that these enzymes 
were largely retained in CS. Lastly, we compared our results to those of other 
dormancy models and propose that CS produces a physiologically distinct state of 
stasis compared to hypoxia in Mtb.IMPORTANCETuberculosis is a devastating human 
disease that kills over 1.2 million people a year. This disease is caused by the 
bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb excels at surviving in 
the human host by entering a non-replicating, dormant state. The current work 
investigated the proteomic changes that Mtb undergoes in response to carbon 
starvation, a culture condition that models dormancy. The authors found broad 
effects of carbon starvation on the proteome, with the relative abundance of 37% 
of proteins significantly altered. Protein changes related to cell wall 
biosynthesis, metabolism, and drug susceptibility are discussed. Proteins 
associated with a carbon starvation phenotype are identified, and results are 
compared to other dormancy models, including hypoxia.

Multiple human diseases are associated with a liquid-to-solid phase transition 
resulting in the formation of amyloid fibers or protein aggregates. Here, we 
present an alternative mechanism for cellular toxicity based on a 
concentration-dependent liquid-liquid demixing. Analyzing proteins that are 
toxic when their concentration is increased in yeast reveals that they share 
physicochemical properties with proteins that participate in physiological 
liquid-liquid demixing in the cell. Increasing the concentration of one of these 
proteins indeed results in the formation of cytoplasmic foci with liquid 
properties. Demixing occurs at the onset of toxicity and titrates proteins and 
mRNAs from the cytoplasm. Focus formation is reversible, and resumption of 
growth occurs as the foci dissolve as protein concentration falls. Preventing 
demixing abolishes the dosage sensitivity of the protein. We propose that 
triggering inappropriate liquid phase separation may be an important cause of 
dosage sensitivity and a determinant of human disease.

The RNA binding proteome (RBPome) was previously investigated using UV 
crosslinking and purification of poly(A)-associated proteins. However, most 
cellular transcripts are not polyadenylated. We therefore developed total 
RNA-associated protein purification (TRAPP) based on 254 nm UV crosslinking and 
purification of all RNA-protein complexes using silica beads. In a variant 
approach (PAR-TRAPP), RNAs were labelled with 4-thiouracil prior to 350 nm 
crosslinking. PAR-TRAPP in yeast identified hundreds of RNA binding proteins, 
strongly enriched for canonical RBPs. In comparison, TRAPP identified many more 
proteins not expected to bind RNA, and this correlated strongly with protein 
abundance. Comparing TRAPP in yeast and E. coli showed apparent conservation of 
RNA binding by metabolic enzymes. Illustrating the value of total RBP 
purification, we discovered that the glycolytic enzyme enolase interacts with 
tRNAs. Exploiting PAR-TRAPP to determine the effects of brief exposure to weak 
acid stress revealed specific changes in late 60S ribosome biogenesis. 
Furthermore, we identified the precise sites of crosslinking for hundreds of 
RNA-peptide conjugates, using iTRAPP, providing insights into potential 
regulation. We conclude that TRAPP is a widely applicable tool for RBPome 
characterization.

Errors in protein translation can lead to non-genetic, phenotypic mutations, 
including amino acid misincorporations. While phenotypic mutations can increase 
protein diversity, the systematic characterization of their proteome-wide 
frequencies and their evolutionary impact has been lacking. Here, we developed a 
mechanistic model of translation errors to investigate how selection acts on 
protein populations produced by amino acid misincorporations. We fitted the 
model to empirical observations of misincorporations obtained from over a 
hundred mass spectrometry datasets of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. We found that 
on average 20% to 23% of proteins synthesized in the cell are expected to harbor 
at least one amino acid misincorporation, and that deleterious misincorporations 
are less likely to occur. Combining misincorporation probabilities and the 
estimated fitness effects of amino acid substitutions in a population genetics 
framework, we found 74% of mistranslation events in E. coli and 94% in S. 
cerevisiae to be neutral. We further show that the set of available synonymous 
tRNAs is subject to evolutionary pressure, as the presence of missing tRNAs 
would increase codon-anticodon cross-reactivity and misincorporation error 
rates. Overall, we find that the translation machinery is likely optimal in E. 
coli and S. cerevisiae and that both local solutions at the level of codons and 
a global solution such as the tRNA pool can mitigate the impact of translation 
errors. We provide a framework to study the evolutionary impact of 
codon-specific translation errors and a method for their proteome-wide detection 
across organisms and conditions.

Errors throughout gene expression are likely deleterious, hence genomes are 
under selection to ameliorate their consequences. Additional stop codons (ASCs) 
are in-frame nonsense 'codons' downstream of the primary stop which may be read 
by translational machinery should the primary stop have been accidentally read 
through. Prior evidence in several eukaryotes suggests that ASCs are selected to 
prevent potentially-deleterious consequences of read-through. We extend this 
evidence showing that enrichment of ASCs is common but not universal for single 
cell eukaryotes. By contrast, there is limited evidence as to whether the same 
is true in other taxa. Here, we provide the first systematic test of the 
hypothesis that ASCs act as a fail-safe mechanism in eubacteria, a group with 
high read-through rates. Contra to the predictions of the hypothesis we find: 
there is paucity, not enrichment, of ASCs downstream; substitutions that degrade 
stops are more frequent in-frame than out-of-frame in 3' sequence; highly 
expressed genes are no more likely to have ASCs than lowly expressed genes; 
usage of the leakiest primary stop (TGA) in highly expressed genes does not 
predict ASC enrichment even compared to usage of non-leaky stops (TAA) in lowly 
expressed genes, beyond downstream codon +1. Any effect at the codon immediately 
proximal to the primary stop can be accounted for by a preference for a T/U 
residue immediately following the stop, although if anything, TT- and TC- 
starting codons are preferred. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence 
for ASC selection in eubacteria. This presents an unusual case in which the same 
error could be solved by the same mechanism in eukaryotes and prokaryotes but is 
not. We discuss two possible explanations: that, owing to the absence of 
nonsense mediated decay, bacteria may solve read-through via gene truncation and 
in eukaryotes certain prion states cause raised read-through rates.

Accurate and efficient folding of nascent protein sequences into their native 
states requires support from the protein homeostasis network. Herein we probe 
which newly translated proteins are thermo-sensitive, making them susceptible to 
misfolding and aggregation under heat stress using pulse-SILAC mass 
spectrometry. We find a distinct group of proteins that is highly sensitive to 
this perturbation when newly synthesized but not once matured. These proteins 
are abundant and highly structured. Notably, they display a tendency to form β 
sheet secondary structures, have more complex folding topology, and are enriched 
for chaperone-binding motifs, suggesting a higher demand for chaperone-assisted 
folding. These polypeptides are also more often components of stable protein 
complexes in comparison with other proteins. Combining these findings suggests 
the existence of a specific subset of proteins in the cell that is particularly 
vulnerable to misfolding and aggregation following synthesis before reaching the 
native state.

Errors in gene transcription can be costly, and organisms have evolved to 
prevent their occurrence or mitigate their costs. The simplest interpretation of 
the drift barrier hypothesis suggests that species with larger population sizes 
would have lower transcriptional error rates. However, Escherichia coli seems to 
have a higher transcriptional error rate than species with lower effective 
population sizes, for example Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This could be explained 
if selection in E. coli were strong enough to maintain adaptations that mitigate 
the consequences of transcriptional errors through robustness, on a gene by gene 
basis, obviating the need for low transcriptional error rates and associated 
costs of global proofreading. Here, we note that if selection is powerful enough 
to evolve local robustness, selection should also be powerful enough to locally 
reduce error rates. We therefore predict that transcriptional error rates will 
be lower in highly abundant proteins on which selection is strongest. However, 
we only expect this result when error rates are high enough to significantly 
impact fitness. As expected, we find such a relationship between expression and 
transcriptional error rate for non-C→U errors in E. coli (especially G→A), but 
not in S. cerevisiae. We do not find this pattern for C→U changes in E. coli, 
presumably because most deamination events occurred during sample preparation, 
but do for C→U changes in S. cerevisiae, supporting the interpretation that C→U 
error rates estimated with an improved protocol, and which occur at rates 
comparable with E. coli non-C→U errors, are biological.

The ubiquity of mass spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomic analyses as a 
component of biological investigation mandates the validation of methodologies 
that increase acquisition efficiency, improve sample coverage, and enhance 
profiling depth. Chromatographic separation is often ignored as an area of 
potential improvement, with most analyses relying on traditional reversed-phase 
liquid chromatography (RPLC); this consistent reliance on a single 
chromatographic paradigm fundamentally limits our view of the observable 
proteome. Herein, we build upon early reports and validate porous graphitic 
carbon chromatography (PGC) as a facile means to substantially enhance proteomic 
coverage without changes to sample preparation, instrument configuration, or 
acquisition methods. Analysis of offline fractionated cell line digests using 
both separations revealed an increase in peptide and protein identifications by 
43% and 24%, respectively. Increased identifications provided more comprehensive 
coverage of cellular components and biological processes independent of protein 
abundance, highlighting the substantial quantity of proteomic information that 
may go undetected in standard analyses. We further utilize these data to reveal 
that label-free quantitative analyses using RPLC separations alone may not be 
reflective of actual protein constituency. Together, these data highlight the 
value and comprehension offered through PGC-MS proteomic analyses. RAW proteomic 
data have been uploaded to the MassIVE repository with the primary accession 
code MSV000091495.

Inteins are genetic mobile elements that are inserted within protein-coding 
genes, which are usually housekeeping genes. They are transcribed and translated 
along with the host gene, then catalyze their own splicing out of the host 
protein, which assumes its functional conformation thereafter. As Prp8 inteins 
are found in several important fungal pathogens and are absent in mammals, they 
are considered potential therapeutic targets since inhibiting their splicing 
would selectively block the maturation of fungal proteins. We developed a 
target-based drug screening system to evaluate the splicing of Prp8 intein from 
the yeast pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (CnePrp8i) using Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae Ura3 as a non-native host protein. In our heterologous system, intein 
splicing preserved the full functionality of Ura3. To validate the system for 
drug screening, we examined cisplatin, which has been described as an intein 
splicing inhibitor. By using our system, new potential protein splicing 
inhibitors may be identified and used, in the future, as a new class of drugs 
for mycosis treatment. Our system also greatly facilitates the visualization of 
CnePrp8i splicing dynamics in vivo.

Extracellular Domains of Transmembrane Proteins Defy the Expression 
Level-Evolutionary Rate Anticorrelation.

Highly expressed proteins tend to evolve slowly, a trend known as the expression 
level-rate of evolution (E-R) anticorrelation. Whereas the reasons for this 
anticorrelation remain unclear, the most influential hypotheses attribute it to 
highly expressed proteins being subjected to strong selective pressures to avoid 
misfolding and/or misinteraction. In accordance with these hypotheses, work in 
our laboratory has recently shown that extracellular (secreted) proteins lack an 
E-R anticorrelation (or exhibit a weaker than usual E-R anticorrelation). 
Extracellular proteins are folded inside the endoplasmic reticulum, where 
enhanced quality control of folding mechanisms exist, and function in the 
extracellular space, where misinteraction is unlikely to occur or to produce 
deleterious effects. Transmembrane proteins contain both intracellular domains 
(which are folded and function in the cytosol) and extracellular domains (which 
complete their folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and function in the 
extracellular space). We thus hypothesized that the extracellular domains of 
transmembrane proteins should exhibit a weaker E-R anticorrelation than their 
intracellular domains. Our analyses of human, Saccharomyces and Arabidopsis 
transmembrane proteins allowed us to confirm our hypothesis. Our results are in 
agreement with models attributing the E-R anticorrelation to the deleterious 
effects of misfolding and/or misinteraction.

Connectivity webs mediate the unique biology of the mammalian brain. Yet, while 
cell circuit maps are increasingly available, knowledge of their underlying 
molecular networks remains limited. Here, we applied multi-dimensional 
biochemical fractionation with mass spectrometry and machine learning to survey 
endogenous macromolecules across the adult mouse brain. We defined a global 
"interactome" comprising over one thousand multi-protein complexes. These 
include hundreds of brain-selective assemblies that have distinct physical and 
functional attributes, show regional and cell-type specificity, and have links 
to core neurological processes and disorders. Using reciprocal pull-downs and a 
transgenic model, we validated a putative 28-member RNA-binding protein complex 
associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, suggesting a coordinated function 
in alternative splicing in disease progression. This brain interaction map 
(BraInMap) resource facilitates mechanistic exploration of the unique molecular 
machinery driving core cellular processes of the central nervous system. It is 
publicly available and can be explored here

Inconsistent results on the association between evolutionary rates and amino 
acid composition of proteins have been reported in eukaryotes. However, there 
are few studies of how amino acid composition can influence evolutionary rates 
in bacteria. Thus, we constructed linear regression models between composition 
frequencies of amino acids and evolutionary rates for bacteria. Compositions of 
all amino acids can on average explain 21.5% of the variation in evolutionary 
rates among 273 investigated bacterial organisms. In five model organisms, amino 
acid composition contributes more to variation in evolutionary rates than 
protein abundance, and frequency of optimal codons. The contribution of 
individual amino acid composition to evolutionary rate varies among organisms. 
The closer the GC-content of genome to its maximum or minimum, the better the 
correlation between the amino acid content and the evolutionary rate of proteins 
would appear in that genome. The types of amino acids that significantly 
contribute to evolutionary rates can be grouped into GC-rich and AT-rich amino 
acids. Besides, the amino acid with high composition also contributes more to 
evolutionary rates than amino acid with low composition in proteome. In summary, 
amino acid composition significantly contributes to the rate of evolution in 
bacterial organisms and this in turn is impacted by GC-content.

BACKGROUND: Malaria has remained a major health concern for decades among people 
living in tropical and sub-tropical countries. Plasmodium falciparum is one of 
the critical species that cause severe malaria and is responsible for major 
mortality. Moreover, the parasite has generated resistance against all WHO 
recommended drugs and therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for 
preventive measures in the form of reliable vaccines to achieve the target of a 
malaria-free world. Surface proteins are the preferable choice for subunit 
vaccine development because they are rapidly detected and engaged by host immune 
cells and vaccination-induced antibodies. Additionally, abundant surface or 
membrane proteins may contribute to the opsonization of pathogens by 
vaccine-induced antibodies.
RESULTS: In our study, we have listed all those surface proteins from the 
literature that could be functionally important and essential for infection and 
immune evasion of the malaria parasite. Eight Plasmodium surface and membrane 
proteins from the pre-erythrocyte and erythrocyte stages were shortlisted. 
Thirty-seven epitopes (B-cell, CTL, and HTL epitopes) from these proteins were 
predicted using immune-informatic tools and joined with suitable peptide linkers 
to design a vaccine construct. A TLR-4 agonist peptide adjuvant was added at the 
N-terminus of the multi-epitope series, followed by the PADRE sequence and EAAAK 
linker. The TLR-4 receptor was docked with the construct's anticipated model 
structure. The complex of vaccine and TLR-4, with the lowest energy -1514, was 
found to be stable under simulated physiological settings.
CONCLUSION: This study has provided a novel multi-epitope construct that may be 
exploited further for the development of an efficient vaccine for malaria.

Translational G proteins, whose release from the ribosome is triggered by GTP 
hydrolysis, regulate protein synthesis. Concomitantly with binding and 
dissociation of protein factors, translation is accompanied by forward and 
reverse rotation between ribosomal subunits. Using single-molecule measurements, 
we explore the ways in which the binding of translational GTPases affects 
inter-subunit rotation of the ribosome. We demonstrate that the highly conserved 
translation factor LepA, whose function remains debated, shifts the equilibrium 
toward the non-rotated conformation of the ribosome. By contrast, the catalyst 
of ribosome translocation, elongation factor G (EF-G), favors the rotated 
conformation of the ribosome. Nevertheless, the presence of P-site peptidyl-tRNA 
and antibiotics, which stabilize the non-rotated conformation of the ribosome, 
only moderately reduces EF-G binding. These results support the model suggesting 
that EF-G interacts with both the non-rotated and rotated conformations of the 
ribosome during mRNA translocation. Our results provide new insights into the 
molecular mechanisms of LepA and EF-G action and underscore the role of ribosome 
structural dynamics in translation.

Recent mass spectrometry maps of the human interactome independently support the 
existence of a large multiprotein complex, dubbed "Commander." Broadly conserved 
across animals and ubiquitously expressed in nearly every human cell type 
examined thus far, Commander likely plays a fundamental cellular function, akin 
to other ubiquitous machines involved in expression, proteostasis, and 
trafficking. Experiments on individual subunits support roles in endosomal 
protein sorting, including the trafficking of Notch proteins, copper 
transporters, and lipoprotein receptors. Commander is critical for vertebrate 
embryogenesis, and defects in the complex and its interaction partners disrupt 
craniofacial, brain, and heart development. Here, we review the synergy between 
large-scale proteomic efforts and focused studies in the discovery of Commander, 
describe its composition, structure, and function, and discuss how it 
illustrates the power of systems biology. Based on 3D modeling and biochemical 
data, we draw strong parallels between Commander and the retromer 
cargo-recognition complex, laying a foundation for future research into 
Commander's role in human developmental disorders.

Redox cofactor production is integral toward antioxidant generation, clearance 
of reactive oxygen species, and overall tumor response to ionizing radiation 
treatment. To identify systems-level alterations in redox metabolism that confer 
resistance to radiation therapy, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for 
integrating multi-omics data into personalized genome-scale flux balance 
analysis models of 716 radiation-sensitive and 199 radiation-resistant tumors. 
These models collectively predicted that radiation-resistant tumors reroute 
metabolic flux to increase mitochondrial NADPH stores and reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) scavenging. Simulated genome-wide knockout screens agreed with 
experimental siRNA gene knockdowns in matched radiation-sensitive and 
radiation-resistant cancer cell lines, revealing gene targets involved in 
mitochondrial NADPH production, central carbon metabolism, and folate metabolism 
that allow for selective inhibition of glutathione production and H2O2 clearance 
in radiation-resistant cancers. This systems approach represents a significant 
advancement in developing quantitative genome-scale models of redox metabolism 
and identifying personalized metabolic targets for improving radiation 
sensitivity in individual cancer patients.

Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is a microtubule-associated, minus end-directed 
motor that traffics hundreds of different cargos. Dynein must discriminate 
between cargos and traffic them at the appropriate time from the correct 
cellular region. How dynein's trafficking activity is regulated in time or 
cellular space remains poorly understood. Here, we identify CCSer2 as the first 
known protein to gate dynein activity in the spatial dimension. CCSer2 promotes 
the migration of developing zebrafish primordium cells, macrophages, and 
cultured human cells by facilitating the trafficking of cargos that are acted on 
by peripherally localized dynein. Our data suggest that CCSer2 disfavors the 
interaction between dynein and its regulator Ndel1 at the cell edge, resulting 
in localized dynein activation. These findings support a model where the spatial 
specificity of dynein is achieved by the localization of proteins that trigger 
Ndel1's release from dynein. We propose that CCSer2 defines a broader class of 
proteins that activate dynein in distinct microenvironments via regulating 
Ndel1-dynein interaction.

Signaling networks are key regulators of cellular function. Although the 
concentrations of signaling proteins are perturbed in disease states, such as 
cancer, and are modulated by drug therapies, our understanding of how such 
changes shape the properties of signaling networks is limited. Here we couple 
mass-cytometry-based single-cell analysis with overexpression of tagged 
signaling proteins to study the dependence of signaling relationships and 
dynamics on protein node abundance. Focusing on the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) signaling network in HEK293T cells, we analyze 20 signaling 
proteins during a 1-h EGF stimulation time course using a panel of 35 
antibodies. Data analysis with BP-R2, a measure that quantifies complex 
signaling relationships, reveals abundance-dependent network states and 
identifies novel signaling relationships. Further, we show that upstream 
signaling proteins have abundance-dependent effects on downstream signaling 
dynamics. Our approach elucidates the influence of node abundance on signal 
transduction networks and will further our understanding of signaling in health 
and disease.

Cell-specific proteomics in multicellular systems and whole animals is a 
promising approach to understand the differentiated functions of cells and 
tissues. Here, we extend our stochastic orthogonal recoding of translation 
(SORT) approach for the co-translational tagging of proteomes with a 
cyclopropene-containing amino acid in response to diverse codons in genetically 
targeted cells, and create a tetrazine-biotin probe containing a cleavable 
linker that offers a way to enrich and identify tagged proteins. We demonstrate 
that SORT with enrichment, SORT-E, efficiently recovers and enriches SORT tagged 
proteins and enables specific identification of enriched proteins via mass 
spectrometry, including low-abundance proteins. We show that tagging at distinct 
codons enriches overlapping, but distinct sets of proteins, suggesting that 
tagging at more than one codon enhances proteome coverage. Using SORT-E, we 
accomplish cell-specific proteomics in the fly. These results suggest that 
SORT-E will enable the definition of cell-specific proteomes in animals during 
development, disease progression, and learning and memory.

There are two paralogous Escherichia coli phosphotransferase systems, one for 
sugar import (PTSsugar) and one for nitrogen regulation (PTSNtr), that utilize 
proteins enzyme Isugar (EIsugar) and HPr, and enzyme INtr (EINtr) and NPr, 
respectively. The enzyme I proteins have similar folds, as do their substrates 
HPr and NPr, yet they show strict specificity for their cognate partner both in 
stereospecific protein-protein complex formation and in reversible 
phosphotransfer. Here, we investigate the mechanism of specific EINtr:NPr 
complex formation by the study of transient encounter complexes. NMR 
paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments demonstrated transient encounter 
complexes of EINtr not only with the expected partner, NPr, but also with the 
unexpected partner, HPr. HPr occupies transient sites on EINtr but is unable to 
complete stereospecific complex formation. By occupying the non-productive 
transient sites, HPr promotes NPr transient interaction to productive sites 
closer to the stereospecific binding site and actually enhances specific complex 
formation between NPr and EINtr. The cellular level of HPr is approximately 150 
times higher than that of NPr. Thus, our finding suggests a potential mechanism 
for cross-regulation of enzyme activity through formation of competitive 
encounter complexes.

Kinase and phosphatase overexpression drives tumorigenesis and drug resistance. 
We previously developed a mass-cytometry-based single-cell proteomics approach 
that enables quantitative assessment of overexpression effects on cell 
signaling. Here, we applied this approach in a human kinome- and 
phosphatome-wide study to assess how 649 individually overexpressed proteins 
modulated cancer-related signaling in HEK293T cells in an abundance-dependent 
manner. Based on these data, we expanded the functional classification of human 
kinases and phosphatases and showed that the overexpression effects include 
non-catalytic roles. We detected 208 previously unreported signaling 
relationships. The signaling dynamics analysis indicated that the overexpression 
of ERK-specific phosphatases sustains proliferative signaling. This suggests a 
phosphatase-driven mechanism of cancer progression. Moreover, our analysis 
revealed a drug-resistant mechanism through which overexpression of tyrosine 
kinases, including SRC, FES, YES1, and BLK, induced MEK-independent ERK 
activation in melanoma A375 cells. These proteins could predict drug sensitivity 
to BRAF-MEK concurrent inhibition in cells carrying BRAF mutations.

Antibodies are a key resource in biomedical research yet there are no 
community-accepted standards to rigorously characterize their quality. Here we 
develop a procedure to validate pre-existing antibodies. Human cell lines with 
high expression of a target, determined through a proteomics database, are 
modified with CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout (KO) the corresponding gene. Commercial 
antibodies against the target are purchased and tested by immunoblot comparing 
parental and KO. Validated antibodies are used to definitively identify the most 
highly expressing cell lines, new KOs are generated if needed, and the lines are 
screened by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Selected antibodies are 
used for more intensive procedures such as immunohistochemistry. The pipeline is 
easy to implement and scalable. Application to the major ALS disease gene 
C9ORF72 identified high-quality antibodies revealing C9ORF72 localization to 
phagosomes/lysosomes. Antibodies that do not recognize C9ORF72 have been used in 
highly cited papers, raising concern over previously reported C9ORF72 
properties.

BACKGROUNDTuberculosis (TB) kills more people than any other infection, and new 
diagnostic tests to identify active cases are required. We aimed to discover and 
verify novel markers for TB in nondepleted plasma.METHODSWe applied an optimized 
quantitative proteomics discovery methodology based on multidimensional and 
orthogonal liquid chromatographic separation combined with high-resolution mass 
spectrometry to study nondepleted plasma of 11 patients with active TB compared 
with 10 healthy controls. Prioritized candidates were verified in independent UK 
(n = 118) and South African cohorts (n = 203).RESULTSWe generated the most 
comprehensive TB plasma proteome to date, profiling 5022 proteins spanning 11 
orders-of-magnitude concentration range with diverse biochemical and molecular 
properties. We analyzed the predominantly low-molecular weight subproteome, 
identifying 46 proteins with significantly increased and 90 with decreased 
abundance (peptide FDR ≤ 1%, q ≤ 0.05). Verification was performed for novel 
candidate biomarkers (CFHR5, ILF2) in 2 independent cohorts. Receiver operating 
characteristics analyses using a 5-protein panel (CFHR5, LRG1, CRP, LBP, and 
SAA1) exhibited discriminatory power in distinguishing TB from other respiratory 
diseases (AUC = 0.81).CONCLUSIONWe report the most comprehensive TB plasma 
proteome to date, identifying novel markers with verification in 2 independent 
cohorts, leading to a 5-protein biosignature with potential to improve TB 
diagnosis. With further development, these biomarkers have potential as a 
diagnostic triage test.FUNDINGColciencias, Medical Research Council, Innovate

MOTIVATION: Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry allows for 
comprehensive peptide detection and relative quantification than standard 
data-dependent approaches. While less prone to missing values, these still 
exist. Current approaches for handling the so-called missingness have 
challenges. We hypothesized that non-random missingness is a useful biological 
measure and demonstrate the importance of analysing missingness for proteomic 
discovery within a longitudinal study of disease activity.
RESULTS: The magnitude of missingness did not correlate with mean peptide 
concentration. The magnitude of missingness for each protein strongly correlated 
between collection time points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months; R = 0.95-0.97, 
confidence interval = 0.94-0.97) indicating little time-dependent effect. This 
allowed for the identification of proteins with outlier levels of missingness 
that differentiate between the patient groups characterized by different 
patterns of disease activity. The association of these proteins with disease 
activity was confirmed by machine learning techniques. Our novel approach 
complements analyses on complete observations and other missing value strategies 
in biomarker prediction of disease activity.

tRNA modifications are crucial for efficient protein synthesis, impacting codon 
recognition, tRNA stability, and translation rates. RNA viruses hijack the 
host's translational machinery, including the pool of modified tRNA, to 
translate their own genomes. However, the mismatch between viral and host codon 
usage can lead to a limited availability of specific tRNA leading to ribosome 
stalling, posing a significant challenge for efficient protein translation. 
While some viruses address this challenge through codon optimization, we show 
here that SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus) and the Zika virus (ZIKV; Flavivirus) adopt a 
different approach, manipulating the host tRNA epitranscriptome. Analysis of 
codon bias indices confirmed a substantial divergence between viral and host 
codon usage, revealing a strong preference in viral genes for codons decoded by 
tRNAs requiring U34 wobble modification. Monitoring tRNA modification dynamics 
in infected cells showed that both SARS-CoV2 and ZIKV enhance U34 tRNA 
modifications during infection. Strikingly, impairing U34 tRNAs profoundly 
impacted viral replication, underscoring the strict reliance of SARS-CoV-2 and 
ZIKV on manipulating the host tRNA epitranscriptome to support the efficient 
translation of their genome.

The identification of host / pathogen interactions is essential to both 
understanding the molecular biology of infection and developing rational 
intervention strategies to overcome disease. Alphaviruses, such as Sindbis 
virus, Chikungunya virus, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus are medically 
relevant positive-sense RNA viruses. As such, they must interface with the host 
machinery to complete their infectious lifecycles. Nonetheless, exhaustive 
RNA:Protein interaction discovery approaches have not been reported for any 
alphavirus species. Thus, the breadth and evolutionary conservation of host 
interactions on alphaviral RNA function remains a critical gap in the field. 
Herein we describe the application of the Cross-Link Assisted mRNP Purification 
(CLAMP) strategy to identify conserved alphaviral interactions. Through 
comparative analyses, conserved alphaviral host / pathogen interactions were 
identified. Approximately 100 unique host proteins were identified as a result 
of these analyses. Ontological assessments reveal enriched Molecular Functions 
and Biological Processes relevant to alphaviral infection. Specifically, as 
anticipated, Poly(A) RNA Binding proteins are significantly enriched in virus 
specific CLAMP data sets. Moreover, host proteins involved in the regulation of 
mRNA stability, proteasome mediated degradation, and a number of 14-3-3 proteins 
were identified. Importantly, these data expand the understanding of alphaviral 
host / pathogen interactions by identifying conserved interactants.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) presentation of peptides is a prerequisite of 
T cell immune activation. The understanding of the rules defining this event has 
large implications for our knowledge of basic immunology and for the rational 
design of immuno-therapeutics and vaccines. Historically, most of the available 
prediction methods have been solely focused on the information related to 
antigen processing and presentation. Recent work has, however, demonstrated that 
method performance can be boosted by integrating information related to antigen 
abundance. Here we expand on these later findings and develop an extended 
version of NetMHCpan, called NetMHCpanExp, integrating information on antigen 
abundance from RNA-Seq experiments. In line with earlier works, the model 
demonstrates improved performance for both HLA ligand and cancer neoantigen 
epitope prediction. Optimal results are obtained by use of sample-specific 
abundance information but also reference datasets can be applied with a limited 
performance drop. The developed tool is available at 
https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetMHCpanExp-1.0.

Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne RNA viruses which can cause either mild to 
severe febrile arthritis which may persist for months, or encephalitis which can 
lead to death or lifelong cognitive impairments. The non-assembly molecular 
role(s), functions, and protein-protein interactions of the alphavirus capsid 
proteins have been largely overlooked. Here we detail the use of a BioID2 biotin 
ligase system to identify the protein-protein interactions of the Sindbis virus 
capsid protein. These efforts led to the discovery of a series of novel 
host-pathogen interactions, including the identification of an interaction 
between the alphaviral capsid protein and the host IRAK1 protein. Importantly, 
this capsid-IRAK1 interaction is conserved across multiple alphavirus species, 
including arthritogenic alphaviruses SINV, Ross River virus, and Chikungunya 
virus; and encephalitic alphaviruses Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus, and 
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus. The impact of the capsid-IRAK1 interaction 
was evaluated using a robust set of cellular model systems, leading to the 
realization that the alphaviral capsid protein specifically inhibits 
IRAK1-dependent signaling. This inhibition represents a means by which 
alphaviruses may evade innate immune detection and activation prior to viral 
gene expression. Altogether, these data identify novel capsid protein-protein 
interactions, establish the capsid-IRAK1 interaction as a common alphavirus 
host-pathogen interface, and delineate the molecular consequences of the 
capsid-IRAK1 interaction on IRAK1-dependent signaling.

NADPH is the primary source of cellular reductant for biosynthesis, and 
strategies for increasing productivity via metabolic engineering need to take 
account of the requirement for reducing power. In plants, while the oxidative 
pentose phosphate pathway is the most direct route for NADPH production in 
heterotrophic tissues, there is increasing evidence that other pathways make 
significant contributions to redox balance. Deuterium-based isotopic labelling 
strategies have recently been developed to quantify the relative production of 
NADPH from different pathways in mammalian cells, but the application of these 
methods to plants has not been critically evaluated. In this study, LC-MS was 
used to measure deuterium incorporation into metabolites extracted from 
heterotrophic Arabidopsis cell cultures grown on [1-2H]glucose or D2O. The 
results show that a high rate of flavin-enzyme-catalysed water exchange obscures 
labelling of NADPH from deuterated substrates and that this exchange cannot be 
accurately accounted for due to exchange between triose- and hexose-phosphates. 
In addition, the duplication of NADPH generating reactions between subcellular 
compartments can confound analysis based on whole cell extracts. Understanding 
how the structure of the metabolic network affects the applicability of 
deuterium labelling methods is a prerequisite for development of more effective 
flux determination strategies, ensuring data are both quantitative and 
representative of endogenous biological processes.

Fundamental discoveries have shaped our molecular understanding of presynaptic 
processes, such as neurotransmitter release, active zone organization and 
mechanisms of synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling. However, certain regulatory steps 
still remain incompletely understood. Protein liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) and its role in SV clustering and active zone regulation now introduce a 
new perception of how the presynapse and its different compartments are 
organized. This article highlights the newly emerging concept of LLPS at the 
synapse, providing a systematic overview on LLPS tendencies of over 500 
presynaptic proteins, spotlighting individual proteins and discussing recent 
progress in the field. Newly discovered LLPS systems like ELKS/liprin-alpha and 
Eps15/FCho are put into context, and further LLPS candidate proteins, including 
epsin1, dynamin, synaptojanin, complexin and rabphilin-3A, are highlighted.

Proteins and their functional interactions form the backbone of the cellular 
machinery. Their connectivity network needs to be considered for the full 
understanding of biological phenomena, but the available information on 
protein-protein associations is incomplete and exhibits varying levels of 
annotation granularity and reliability. The STRING database aims to collect, 
score and integrate all publicly available sources of protein-protein 
interaction information, and to complement these with computational predictions. 
Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including 
direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest 
version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 
5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide 
datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks 
and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the 
enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as 
Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems 
based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of 
the association network itself. The STRING resource is available online at 
https://string-db.org/.

Unusual mammalian usage of TGA stop codons reveals that sequence conservation 
need not imply purifying selection.

The assumption that conservation of sequence implies the action of purifying 
selection is central to diverse methodologies to infer functional importance. 
GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a meiotic mismatch repair bias strongly 
favouring GC over AT, can in principle mimic the action of selection, this being 
thought to be especially important in mammals. As mutation is GC→AT biased, to 
demonstrate that gBGC does indeed cause false signals requires evidence that an 
AT-rich residue is selectively optimal compared to its more GC-rich allele, 
while showing also that the GC-rich alternative is conserved. We propose that 
mammalian stop codon evolution provides a robust test case. Although in most 
taxa TAA is the optimal stop codon, TGA is both abundant and conserved in 
mammalian genomes. We show that this mammalian exceptionalism is well explained 
by gBGC mimicking purifying selection and that TAA is the selectively optimal 
codon. Supportive of gBGC, we observe (i) TGA usage trends are consistent at the 
focal stop codon and elsewhere (in UTR sequences); (ii) that higher TGA usage 
and higher TAA→TGA substitution rates are predicted by a high recombination 
rate; and (iii) across species the difference in TAA <-> TGA substitution rates 
between GC-rich and GC-poor genes is largest in genomes that possess higher 
between-gene GC variation. TAA optimality is supported both by enrichment in 
highly expressed genes and trends associated with effective population size. 
High TGA usage and high TAA→TGA rates in mammals are thus consistent with gBGC's 
predicted ability to "drive" deleterious mutations and supports the hypothesis 
that sequence conservation need not be indicative of purifying selection. A 
general trend for GC-rich trinucleotides to reside at frequencies far above 
their mutational equilibrium in high recombining domains supports the generality 
of these results.

Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal for the human organism and for all ecosystems. Cd 
is naturally found at low levels; however, higher amounts of Cd in the 
environment result from human activities as it spreads into the air and water in 
the form of micropollutants as a consequence of industrial processes, pollution, 
waste incineration, and electronic waste recycling. The human body has a limited 
ability to respond to Cd exposure since the metal does not undergo metabolic 
degradation into less toxic species and is only poorly excreted. The extremely 
long biological half-life of Cd essentially makes it a cumulative toxin; chronic 
exposure causes harmful effects from the metal stored in the organs. The present 
paper considers exposure and potential health concerns due to environmental 
cadmium. Exposure to Cd compounds is primarily associated with an elevated risk 
of lung, kidney, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Cd has also been linked to 
cancers of the breast, urinary system, and bladder. The multiple mechanisms of 
Cd-induced carcinogenesis include oxidative stress with the inhibition of 
antioxidant enzymes, the promotion of lipid peroxidation, and interference with 
DNA repair systems. Cd2+ can also replace essential metal ions, including 
redox-active ones. A total of 12 cancer types associated with specific genes 
coding for the Cd-metalloproteome were identified in this work. In addition, we 
summarize the proper treatments of Cd poisoning, based on the use of selected Cd 
detoxifying agents and chelators, and the potential for preventive approaches to 
counteract its chronic exposure.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or regions (IDRs) perform diverse 
cellular functions, but are also prone to forming promiscuous and potentially 
deleterious interactions. We investigate the extent to which the properties of, 
and content in, IDRs have adapted to enable functional diversity while limiting 
interference from promiscuous interactions in the crowded cellular environment. 
Information on protein sequences, their predicted intrinsic disorder, and 3D 
structure contents is related to data on protein cellular concentrations, gene 
co-expression, and protein-protein interactions in the well-studied yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Results reveal that both the protein IDR content and 
the frequency of "sticky" amino acids in IDRs (those more frequently involved in 
protein interfaces) decrease with increasing protein cellular concentration. 
This implies that the IDR content and the amino acid composition of IDRs 
experience negative selection as the protein concentration increases. In the S. 
cerevisiae protein-protein interaction network, the higher a protein's IDR 
content, the more frequently it interacts with IDR-containing partners, and the 
more functionally diverse the partners are. Employing a clustering analysis of 
Gene Ontology terms, we newly identify ~600 putative multifunctional proteins in 
S. cerevisiae. Strikingly, these proteins are enriched in IDRs and contribute 
significantly to all the observed trends. In particular, IDRs of 
multi-functional proteins feature more sticky amino acids than IDRs of their 
non-multifunctional counterparts, or the surfaces of structured yeast proteins. 
This property likely affords sufficient binding affinity for the functional 
interactions, commonly mediated by short IDR segments, thereby counterbalancing 
the loss in overall IDR conformational entropy upon binding.

The ability to dynamically control mRNA translation has a great impact on many 
intracellular processes. Whereas it is believed that translational control in 
eukaryotes occurs mainly at initiation, the condition-specific changes at the 
elongation level and their potential regulatory role remain unclear. Using 
computational approaches applied to ribosome profiling data, we show that 
elongation rate is dynamic and can change considerably during the yeast meiosis 
to facilitate the selective translation of stage-specific transcripts. We 
observed unique elongation changes during meiosis II, including a global 
inhibition of translation elongation at the onset of anaphase II accompanied by 
a sharp shift toward increased elongation for genes required at this meiotic 
stage. We also show that ribosomal proteins counteract the global decreased 
elongation by maintaining high initiation rates. Our findings provide new 
insights into gene expression regulation during meiosis and demonstrate that 
codon usage evolved, among others, to optimize timely translation.

The fidelity of signal transduction requires the binding of regulatory molecules 
to their cognate targets. However, the crowded cell interior risks off-target 
interactions between proteins that are functionally unrelated. How such 
off-target interactions impact fitness is not generally known, but quantifying 
this is required to understand the constraints faced by cell systems as they 
evolve. Here, we use the model organism S. cerevisiae to inducibly express 
tyrosine kinases. Because yeast lacks bona fide tyrosine kinases, most of the 
resulting tyrosine phosphorylation is spurious. This provides a suitable system 
to measure the impact of artificial protein interactions on fitness. We 
engineered 44 yeast strains each expressing a tyrosine kinase, and 
quantitatively analysed their phosphoproteomes. This analysis resulted in 
~30,000 phosphosites mapping to ~3,500 proteins. Examination of the fitness 
costs in each strain revealed a strong correlation between the number of 
spurious pY sites and decreased growth. Moreover, the analysis of pY effects on 
protein structure and on protein function revealed over 1000 pY events that we 
predict to be deleterious. However, we also find that a large number of the 
spurious pY sites have a negligible effect on fitness, possibly because of their 
low stoichiometry. This result is consistent with our evolutionary analyses 
demonstrating a lack of phosphotyrosine counter-selection in species with bona 
fide tyrosine kinases. Taken together, our results suggest that, alongside the 
risk for toxicity, the cell can tolerate a large degree of non-functional 
crosstalk as interaction networks evolve.

Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A (PPP1R12A) interacts with the 
catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) to form the myosin phosphatase 
complex. In addition to a well-documented role in muscle contraction, the 
PP1c-PPP1R12A complex is associated with cytoskeleton organization, cell 
migration and adhesion, and insulin signaling. Despite the variety of biological 
functions, only a few substrates of the PP1c-PPP1R12A complex are characterized, 
which limit a full understanding of PP1c-PPP1R12A activities in muscle 
contraction and cytoskeleton regulation. Here, the chemoproteomics method 
Kinase-catalyzed Biotinylation to Identify Phosphatase Substrates (K-BIPS) was 
used to identify substrates of the PP1c-PPP1R12A complex in L6 skeletal muscle 
cells. K-BIPS enriched 136 candidate substrates with 14 high confidence hits. 
One high confidence hit, AKT1 kinase, was validated as a novel PP1c-PPP1R12A 
substrate. Given the previously documented role of AKT1 in PPP1R12A 
phosphorylation and cytoskeleton organization, the data suggest that 
PP1c-PPP1R12A regulates its own phosphatase activity through an AKT1-dependent 
feedback mechanism to influence cytoskeletal arrangement in muscle cells.

ABSTRACT: Physiological and molecular similarities between organisms make it 
possible to translate findings from simpler experimental systems—model 
organisms—into more complex ones, such as human. This translation facilitates 
the understanding of biological processes under normal or disease conditions. 
Researchers aiming to identify the similarities and differences between 
organisms at the molecular level need resources collecting multi-organism tissue 
expression data. We have developed a database of gene–tissue associations in 
human, mouse, rat and pig by integrating multiple sources of evidence: 
transcriptomics covering all four species and proteomics (human only), manually 
curated and mined from the scientific literature. Through a scoring scheme, 
these associations are made comparable across all sources of evidence and across 
organisms. Furthermore, the scoring produces a confidence score assigned to each 
of the associations. The TISSUES database (version 2.0) is publicly accessible 
through a user-friendly web interface and as part of the STRING app for 
Cytoscape. In addition, we analyzed the agreement between datasets, across and 
within organisms, and identified that the agreement is mainly affected by the 
quality of the datasets rather than by the technologies used or organisms 
compared.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a ubiquitous member of the body and is key to 
the maintenance of tissue and organ integrity. Initially thought to be a 
bystander in many cellular processes, the extracellular matrix has been shown to 
have diverse components that regulate and activate many cellular processes and 
ultimately influence cell phenotype. Importantly, the ECM's composition, 
architecture, and stiffness/elasticity influence cellular phenotypes. Under 
normal conditions and during development, the synthesized ECM constantly 
undergoes degradation and remodeling processes via the action of matrix 
proteases that maintain tissue homeostasis. In many pathological conditions 
including fibrosis and cancer, ECM synthesis, remodeling, and degradation is 
dysregulated, causing its integrity to be altered. Both physical and chemical 
cues from the ECM are sensed via receptors including integrins and play key 
roles in driving cellular proliferation and differentiation and in the 
progression of various diseases such as cancers. Advances in 'omics' 
technologies have seen an increase in studies focusing on bidirectional 
cell-matrix interactions, and here, we highlight the emerging knowledge on the 
role played by the ECM during normal development and in pathological conditions. 
This review summarizes current ECM-targeted therapies that can modify ECM tumors 
to overcome drug resistance and better cancer treatment.

Nitrogen metabolism of M. tuberculosis is critical for its survival in infected 
host cells. M. tuberculosis has evolved sophisticated strategies to switch 
between de novo synthesis and uptake of various amino acids from host cells for 
metabolic demands. Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent histidinol phosphate 
aminotransferase-HspAT enzyme is critically required for histidine biosynthesis. 
HspAT is involved in metabolic synthesis of histidine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, 
tryptophan, and novobiocin. We showed that M. tuberculosis Rv2231c is a 
conserved enzyme with HspAT activity. Rv2231c is a monomeric globular protein 
that contains α-helices and β-sheets. It is a secretory and cell wall-localized 
protein that regulates critical pathogenic attributes. Rv2231c enhances the 
survival and virulence of recombinant M. smegmatis in infected RAW264.7 
macrophage cells. Rv2231c is recognized by the TLR4 innate immune receptor and 
modulates the host immune response by suppressing the secretion of the 
antibacterial pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-12, and IL-6. It also inhibits 
the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 along with antigen 
presenting molecule MHC-I on macrophage and suppresses reactive nitrogen species 
formation, thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Recombinant M. 
smegmatis expressing Rv2231c inhibited apoptosis in macrophages, promoting 
efficient bacterial survival and proliferation, thereby increasing virulence. 
Our results indicate that Rv2231c is a moonlighting protein that regulates 
multiple functions of M. tuberculosis pathophysiology to increase its virulence. 
These mechanistic insights can be used to better understand the pathogenesis of 
M. tuberculosis and to design strategies for tuberculosis mitigation.

Yeast vacuoles perform crucial cellular functions as acidic degradative 
organelles, storage compartments, and signaling hubs. These functions are 
mediated by important protein complexes, including the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase 
(V-ATPase), responsible for organelle acidification. To gain a more detailed 
understanding of vacuole function, we performed cross-linking mass spectrometry 
on isolated vacuoles, detecting many known as well as novel protein-protein 
interactions. Among these, we identified the uncharacterized 
TLDc-domain-containing protein Rtc5 as a novel interactor of the V-ATPase. We 
further analyzed the influence of Rtc5 and of Oxr1, the only other yeast 
TLDc-domain-containing protein, on V-ATPase function. We find that both Rtc5 and 
Oxr1 promote the disassembly of the vacuolar V-ATPase in vivo, counteracting the 
role of the RAVE complex, a V-ATPase assembly chaperone. Furthermore, Oxr1 is 
necessary for the retention of a Golgi-specific subunit of the V-ATPase in this 
compartment. Collectively, our results shed light on the in vivo roles of yeast 
TLDc-domain proteins as regulators of the V-ATPase, highlighting the 
multifaceted regulation of this crucial protein complex.

Individual tissues perform highly specialized metabolic functions to maintain 
whole-body homeostasis. Although Drosophila serves as a powerful model for 
studying human metabolic diseases, a lack of tissue-specific metabolic models 
makes it challenging to quantitatively assess the metabolic processes of 
individual tissues and disease models in this organism. To address this issue, 
we reconstructed 32 tissue-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) using 
pseudo-bulk single cell transcriptomics data, revealing distinct metabolic 
network structures across tissues. Leveraging enzyme kinetics and flux analyses, 
we predicted tissue-dependent metabolic pathway activities, recapitulating known 
tissue functions and identifying tissue-specific metabolic signatures, as 
supported by metabolite profiling. Moreover, to demonstrate the utility of 
tissue-specific GEMs in a disease context, we examined the effect of a high 
sugar diet (HSD) on muscle metabolism. Together with 13C-glucose isotopic tracer 
studies, we identified glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a 
rate-limiting enzyme in response to HSD. Mechanistically, the decreased GAPDH 
activity was linked to elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, caused by disturbed NAD+ 
regeneration rates, and oxidation of GAPDH. Furthermore, we introduced a pathway 
flux index to predict and validate additionally perturbed pathways, including 
fructose and butanoate metabolism. Altogether, our results represent a 
significant advance in generating quantitative tissue-specific GEMs and flux 
analyses in Drosophila, highlighting their use for identifying dysregulated 
metabolic pathways and their regulation in a human disease model.

Measuring changes in protein or organelle abundance in the cell is an essential, 
but challenging aspect of cell biology. Frequently-used methods for determining 
organelle abundance typically rely on detection of a very few marker proteins, 
so are unsatisfactory. In silico estimates of protein abundances from publicly 
available protein spectra can provide useful standard abundance values but 
contain only data from tissue proteomes, and are not coupled to organelle 
localization data. A new protein abundance score, the normalized protein 
abundance scale (NPAS), expands on the number of scored proteins and the scoring 
accuracy of lower-abundance proteins in Arabidopsis. NPAS was combined with 
subcellular protein localization data, facilitating quantitative estimations of 
organelle abundance during routine experimental procedures. A suite of targeted 
proteomics markers for subcellular compartment markers was developed, enabling 
independent verification of in silico estimates for relative organelle 
abundance. Estimation of relative organelle abundance was found to be 
reproducible and consistent over a range of tissues and growth conditions. In 
silico abundance estimations and localization data have been combined into an 
online tool, multiple marker abundance profiling, available in the SUBA4 toolbox 
(http://suba.live).

The 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail of mRNA are known to synergistically stimulate 
translation initiation via the formation of the cap•eIF4E•eIF4G•PABP•poly(A) 
complex. Most mRNA sequences have an intrinsic propensity to fold into extensive 
intramolecular secondary structures that result in short end-to-end distances. 
The inherent compactness of mRNAs might stabilize the 
cap•eIF4E•eIF4G•PABP•poly(A) complex and enhance cap-poly(A) translational 
synergy. Here, we test this hypothesis by introducing intrinsically unstructured 
sequences into the 5' or 3' UTRs of model mRNAs. We found that the introduction 
of unstructured sequences into the 3' UTR, but not the 5' UTR, decreases mRNA 
translation in cell-free wheat germ and yeast extracts without affecting mRNA 
stability. The observed reduction in protein synthesis results from the 
diminished ability of the poly(A) tail to stimulate translation. These results 
suggest that base pair formation by the 3' UTR enhances the cap-poly(A) synergy 
in translation initiation.

COPI-coated vesicles mediate retrograde membrane traffic from the cis-Golgi to 
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in all eukaryotic cells. However, it is still 
unknown whether COPI vesicles fuse everywhere or at specific sites with the ER 
membrane. Taking advantage of the circumstance that the vesicles still carry 
their coat when they arrive at the ER, we have visualized active ER arrival 
sites (ERAS) by monitoring contact between COPI coat components and the 
ER-resident Dsl tethering complex using bimolecular fluorescence complementation 
(BiFC). ERAS form punctate structures near Golgi compartments, clearly distinct 
from ER exit sites. Furthermore, ERAS are highly polarized in an actin and 
myosin V-dependent manner and are localized near hotspots of plasma membrane 
expansion. Genetic experiments suggest that the COPI•Dsl BiFC complexes 
recapitulate the physiological interaction between COPI and the Dsl complex and 
that COPI vesicles are mistargeted in dsl1 mutants. We conclude that the Dsl 
complex functions in confining COPI vesicle fusion sites.

The cellular proteome is a complex microcosm of structural and regulatory 
networks that requires continuous surveillance and modification to meet the 
dynamic needs of the cell. It is therefore crucial that the protein flux of the 
cell remains in balance to ensure proper cell function. Genetic alterations that 
range from chromosome imbalance to oncogene activation can affect the speed, 
fidelity and capacity of protein biogenesis and degradation systems, which often 
results in proteome imbalance. An improved understanding of the causes and 
consequences of proteome imbalance is helping to reveal how these systems can be 
targeted to treat diseases such as cancer.

Metabolic engineering uses enzymes as parts to build biosystems for specified 
tasks. Although a part's working life and failure modes are key engineering 
performance indicators, this is not yet so in metabolic engineering because it 
is not known how long enzymes remain functional in vivo or whether cumulative 
deterioration (wear-out), sudden random failure, or other causes drive 
replacement. Consequently, enzymes cannot be engineered to extend life and cut 
the high energy costs of replacement. Guided by catalyst engineering, we adopted 
catalytic cycles until replacement (CCR) as a metric for enzyme functional life 
span in vivo. CCR is the number of catalytic cycles that an enzyme mediates in 
vivo before failure or replacement, i.e., metabolic flux rate/protein turnover 
rate. We used estimated fluxes and measured protein turnover rates to calculate 
CCRs for ∼100-200 enzymes each from Lactococcus lactis, yeast, and Arabidopsis 
CCRs in these organisms had similar ranges (<103 to >107) but different median 
values (3-4 × 104 in L. lactis and yeast versus 4 × 105 in Arabidopsis). In all 
organisms, enzymes whose substrates, products, or mechanisms can attack reactive 
amino acid residues had significantly lower median CCR values than other 
enzymes. Taken with literature on mechanism-based inactivation, the latter 
finding supports the proposal that 1) random active-site damage by reaction 
chemistry is an important cause of enzyme failure, and 2) reactive noncatalytic 
residues in the active-site region are likely contributors to damage 
susceptibility. Enzyme engineering to raise CCRs and lower replacement costs may 
thus be both beneficial and feasible.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a molecular process that leads to the 
formation of membraneless organelles, representing functionally specialized 
liquid-like cellular condensates formed by proteins and nucleic acids. 
Integrating the data on LLPS-associated proteins from dedicated databases 
revealed only modest agreement between them and yielded a high-confidence 
dataset of 89 human LLPS drivers. Analysis of the supporting evidence for our 
dataset uncovered a systematic and potentially concerning difference between 
protein concentrations used in a good fraction of the in vitro LLPS experiments, 
a key parameter that governs the phase behavior, and the proteomics-derived 
cellular abundance levels of the corresponding proteins. Closer scrutiny of the 
underlying experimental data enabled us to offer a sound rationale for this 
systematic difference, which draws on our current understanding of the cellular 
organization of the proteome and the LLPS process. In support of this rationale, 
we find that genes coding for our human LLPS drivers tend to be 
dosage-sensitive, suggesting that their cellular availability is tightly 
regulated to preserve their functional role in direct or indirect relation to 
condensate formation. Our analysis offers guideposts for increasing agreement 
between in vitro and in vivo studies, probing the roles of proteins in LLPS.

The 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved adaptor protein family with 
multi-layer functions, abundantly expressed in the brain. The 14-3-3 proteins 
modulate phosphorylation, regulate enzymatic activity and can act as chaperones. 
Most importantly, they play an important role in various neurodegenerative 
disorders due to their vast interaction partners. Particularly, the 14-3-3ζ 
isoform is known to co-localize in aggregation tangles in both Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases as a result of protein-protein interactions. These abnormal 
clumps consist of amyloid fibrils, insoluble aggregates, mainly formed by the 
amyloid-β, tau and α-synuclein proteins. However, the molecular basis of if and 
how 14-3-3ζ can aggregate into amyloid fibrils is unknown. In this study, we 
describe the formation of amyloid fibrils by 14-3-3ζ using a comprehensive 
approach that combines bioinformatic tools, amyloid-specific dye binding, 
secondary structure analysis and atomic force microscopy. The results presented 
herein characterize the amyloidogenic properties of 14-3-3ζ and imply that the 
well-folded protein undergoes aggregation to β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils.

Efficient and accurate protein synthesis is crucial for organismal survival in 
competitive environments. Translation efficiency (the number of proteins 
translated from a single mRNA in a given time period) is the combined result of 
differential translation initiation, elongation, and termination rates. Previous 
research identified the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence as a modulator of 
translation initiation in bacterial genes, while codon usage biases are 
frequently implicated as a primary determinant of elongation rate variation. 
Recent studies have suggested that SD sequences within coding sequences may 
negatively affect translation elongation speed, but this claim remains 
controversial. Here, we present a metric to quantify the prevalence of SD 
sequences in coding regions. We analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes and find 
that the coding sequences of highly expressed genes systematically contain fewer 
SD sequences than expected, yielding a robust correlation between the normalized 
occurrence of SD sites and protein abundances across a range of bacterial taxa. 
We further show that depletion of SD sequences within ribosomal protein genes is 
correlated with organismal growth rates, supporting the hypothesis of strong 
selection against the presence of these sequences in coding regions and 
suggesting their association with translation efficiency in bacteria.

Cellular proteomes are distributed in multiple compartments: on DNA, ribosomes, 
on and inside membranes, or they become secreted. Structural properties that 
allow polypeptides to occupy subcellular niches, particularly to after crossing 
membranes, remain unclear. We compared intrinsic and extrinsic features in 
cytoplasmic and secreted polypeptides of the Escherichia coli K-12 proteome. 
Structural features between the cytoplasmome and secretome are sharply distinct, 
such that a signal peptide-agnostic machine learning tool distinguishes 
cytoplasmic from secreted proteins with 95.5% success. Cytoplasmic polypeptides 
are enriched in aliphatic, aromatic, charged and hydrophobic residues, unique 
folds and higher early folding propensities. Secretory polypeptides are enriched 
in polar/small amino acids, β folds, have higher backbone dynamics, higher 
disorder and contact order and are more often intrinsically disordered. These 
non-random distributions and experimental evidence imply that evolutionary 
pressure selected enhanced secretome flexibility, slow folding and looser 
structures, placing the secretome in a distinct protein class. These adaptations 
protect the secretome from premature folding during its cytoplasmic transit, 
optimize its lipid bilayer crossing and allowed it to acquire cell envelope 
specific chemistries. The latter may favor promiscuous multi-ligand binding, 
sensing of stress and cell envelope structure changes. In conclusion, enhanced 
flexibility, slow folding, looser structures and unique folds differentiate the 
secretome from the cytoplasmome. These findings have wide implications on the 
structural diversity and evolution of modern proteomes and the protein folding 
problem.

In-cell NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to determine the properties of 
proteins and nucleic acids within living cells. In-cell NMR can give 
site-specific measurements of interactions, modifications, and dynamics as well 
as their modulation by the cellular environment. In-cell NMR requires selective 
incorporation of heavy isotopes into a protein of interest, either through the 
introduction of exogenously produced protein to a cell's interior or the 
selective overexpression of a protein. We developed conditions to allow the use 
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was chosen because of its genetic 
tractability, as a eukaryotic expression system for in-cell NMR. We demonstrate 
this technique using a fragment of S. cerevisiae Nsp1, an FG Nup. FG Nups are 
intrinsically disordered proteins containing phenylalanine (F)-glycine (G) 
repeats and form the selective barrier within the nuclear pore complex. Yeast FG 
Nups have previously been shown to be maintained in a highly dynamic state 
within living bacteria as measured by in-cell NMR. Interactions thought to 
stabilize this dynamic state are also present in the protein's native organism, 
although site specificity of interaction is different between the two cytosols.

Thrombo-occlusive diseases such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and 
deep vein thrombosis with subsequent pulmonary embolism still represent a major 
health burden worldwide. Besides the cells of the vasculature or other 
hematopoietic cells, platelets are primarily responsible for the development and 
progression of an occluding thrombus. The activation and function of platelets 
crucially depend on free cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) as second messenger, which 
modulates platelet secretion, aggregation and thrombus formation. Ca2+ is 
elevated upon platelet activation by release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores 
thus triggering of the subsequent store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which is 
facilitated by Ca2+ release-activated channels (CRACs). In general, CRACs are 
assembled by the pore-forming unit Orai in the plasma membrane and the 
Ca2+-sensing stromal interaction molecule (STIM) in the endoplasmic reticulum 
after the depletion of internal Ca2+ stores. In the last few years, there is a 
growing body of the literature demonstrating the importance of STIM and 
Orai-mediated mechanism in thrombo-occlusive disorders. Thus, this review 
provides an overview of the recent understanding of STIM and Orai signaling in 
platelet function and its implication in the development and progression of 
ischemic thrombo-occlusive disorders. Moreover, potential pharmacological 
implications of STIM and Orai signaling in platelets are anticipated and 
discussed in the end.

Mitochondria are a hallmark of eukaryal cells and play an important role in 
cellular metabolism. There is a vast amount of knowledge available on 
mitochondrial metabolism and essential mitochondrial functions, such as protein 
import and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, including multiple studies on the 
mitochondrial proteome. Therefore, there is a need for in silico approaches to 
facilitate the analysis of these data. Here, we present a detailed model of 
mitochondrial metabolism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including protein import, 
iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, and a description of the coupling between 
charge translocation processes and ATP synthesis. Model analysis implied a dual 
dependence of absolute levels of proteins in protein import, iron-sulfur cluster 
biogenesis and cluster abundance on growth rate and respiratory activity. The 
model is instrumental in studying dynamics and perturbations in these processes 
and given the high conservation of mitochondrial metabolism in humans, it can 
provide insight into their role in human disease.

Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translation modification essential 
in cell signaling. This study addresses a long-standing question as to how the 
most abundant serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) holoenzyme, 
PP2A/B55α, specifically recognizes substrates and presents them to the enzyme 
active site. Here, we show how the PP2A regulatory subunit B55α recruits p107, a 
pRB-related tumor suppressor and B55α substrate. Using molecular and cellular 
approaches, we identified a conserved region 1 (R1, residues 615-626) 
encompassing the strongest p107 binding site. This enabled us to identify an 
'HxRVxxV619-625' short linear motif (SLiM) in p107 as necessary for B55α binding 
and dephosphorylation of the proximal pSer-615 in vitro and in cells. Numerous 
B55α/PP2A substrates, including TAU, contain a related SLiM C-terminal from a 
proximal phosphosite, 'p[ST]-P-x(4,10)-[RK]-V-x-x-[VI]-R.' Mutation of conserved 
SLiM residues in TAU dramatically inhibits dephosphorylation by PP2A/B55α, 
validating its generality. A data-guided computational model details the 
interaction of residues from the conserved p107 SLiM, the B55α groove, and 
phosphosite presentation. Altogether, these data provide key insights into 
PP2A/B55α's mechanisms of substrate recruitment and active site engagement, and 
also facilitate identification and validation of new substrates, a key step 
towards understanding PP2A/B55α's role in multiple cellular processes.

The C-terminal sequence of a protein is involved in processes such as efficiency 
of translation termination and protein degradation. However, the general 
relationship between features of this C-terminal sequence and levels of protein 
expression remains unknown. Here, we identified C-terminal amino acid biases 
that are ubiquitous across the bacterial taxonomy (1,582 genomes). We showed 
that the frequency is higher for positively charged amino acids (lysine, 
arginine), while hydrophobic amino acids and threonine are lower. We then 
studied the impact of C-terminal composition on protein levels in a library of 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae mutants, covering all possible combinations of the two 
last codons. We found that charged and polar residues, in particular lysine, led 
to higher expression, while hydrophobic and aromatic residues led to lower 
expression, with a difference in protein levels up to fourfold. We further 
showed that modulation of protein degradation rate could be one of the main 
mechanisms driving these differences. Our results demonstrate that the identity 
of the last amino acids has a strong influence on protein expression levels.

Ribose 2'-O-methylation is involved in critical biological processes, but its 
biological functions and significance in mRNAs remain underexplored. We have 
developed NJU-seq, a sensitive method for unbiased 2'-O-methylation (Nm) 
profiling, and Nm-VAQ, a site-specific quantification tool. Using these tools in 
tandem, we identified thousands of Nm sites on mRNAs of human and mouse cell 
lines, of which 68 of 84 selected sites were further validated to be more than 
1% 2'-O-methylated. Unlike rRNA, most mRNA Nm sites were from 1% to 30% 
methylated. In addition, mRNA Nm was dynamic, changing according to the 
circumstance. Furthermore, we show that fibrillarin is involved as a 
methyltransferase. By mimicking the detected Nm sites and the context sequence, 
the RNA fragments could be 2'-O-methylated and demonstrated higher stability but 
lower translation efficiency. Last, profiling of Nm sites in lung surgery 
samples revealed common signatures of lung cancer pathogenesis, providing 
potential new diagnostic markers.

By the age of 40, one in five adults without symptoms of cardiovascular disease 
are at risk for developing congestive heart failure. Within this population, 
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains one of the leading causes of disease and 
death, with nearly half of cases genetically determined. Though genetic and high 
throughput sequencing-based approaches have identified sporadic and inherited 
mutations in a multitude of genes implicated in cardiomyopathy, how combinations 
of asymptomatic mutations lead to cardiac failure remains a mystery. Since a 
number of studies have implicated mutations of the transcription factor TBX20 in 
congenital heart diseases, we investigated the underlying mechanisms, using an 
unbiased systems-based screen to identify novel, cardiac-specific binding 
partners. We demonstrated that TBX20 physically and genetically interacts with 
the essential transcription factor CASZ1. This interaction is required for 
survival, as mice heterozygous for both Tbx20 and Casz1 die post-natally as a 
result of DCM. A Tbx20 mutation associated with human familial DCM sterically 
interferes with the TBX20-CASZ1 interaction and provides a physical basis for 
how this human mutation disrupts normal cardiac function. Finally, we employed 
quantitative proteomic analyses to define the molecular pathways mis-regulated 
upon disruption of this novel complex. Collectively, our proteomic, biochemical, 
genetic, and structural studies suggest that the physical interaction between 
TBX20 and CASZ1 is required for cardiac homeostasis, and further, that reduction 
or loss of this critical interaction leads to DCM. This work provides strong 
evidence that DCM can be inherited through a digenic mechanism.

Thermophilic Adaptation in Prokaryotes Is Constrained by Metabolic Costs of 
Proteostasis.

Prokaryotes evolved to thrive in an extremely diverse set of habitats, and their 
proteomes bear signatures of environmental conditions. Although correlations 
between amino acid usage and environmental temperature are well-documented, 
understanding of the mechanisms of thermal adaptation remains incomplete. Here, 
we couple the energetic costs of protein folding and protein homeostasis to 
build a microscopic model explaining both the overall amino acid composition and 
its temperature trends. Low biosynthesis costs lead to low diversity of physical 
interactions between amino acid residues, which in turn makes proteins less 
stable and drives up chaperone activity to maintain appropriate levels of 
folded, functional proteins. Assuming that the cost of chaperone activity is 
proportional to the fraction of unfolded client proteins, we simulated thermal 
adaptation of model proteins subject to minimization of the total cost of amino 
acid synthesis and chaperone activity. For the first time, we predicted both the 
proteome-average amino acid abundances and their temperature trends 
simultaneously, and found strong correlations between model predictions and 402 
genomes of bacteria and archaea. The energetic constraint on protein evolution 
is more apparent in highly expressed proteins, selected by codon adaptation 
index. We found that in bacteria, highly expressed proteins are similar in 
composition to thermophilic ones, whereas in archaea no correlation between 
predicted expression level and thermostability was observed. At the same time, 
thermal adaptations of highly expressed proteins in bacteria and archaea are 
nearly identical, suggesting that universal energetic constraints prevail over 
the phylogenetic differences between these domains of life.

For more than a decade, the misfolding avoidance hypothesis (MAH) and related 
theories have dominated evolutionary discussions aimed at explaining the 
variance of the molecular clock across cellular proteins. In this study, we use 
various experimental data to further investigate the consistency of the MAH 
predictions with empirical evidence. We also critically discuss experimental 
results that motivated the MAH development and that are often viewed as evidence 
of its major contribution to the variability of protein evolutionary rates. We 
demonstrate, in Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens, the lack of a substantial 
negative correlation between protein evolutionary rates and Gibbs free energies 
of unfolding, a direct measure of protein stability. We then analyze multiple 
new genome-scale data sets characterizing protein aggregation and interaction 
propensities, the properties that are likely optimized in evolution to alleviate 
deleterious effects associated with toxic protein misfolding and 
misinteractions. Our results demonstrate that the propensity of proteins to 
aggregate, the fraction of charged amino acids, and protein stickiness do 
correlate with protein abundances. Nevertheless, across multiple organisms and 
various data sets we do not observe substantial correlations between proteins' 
aggregation- and stability-related properties and evolutionary rates. Therefore, 
diverse empirical data support the conclusion that the MAH and similar 
hypotheses do not play a major role in mediating a strong negative correlation 
between protein expression and the molecular clock, and thus in explaining the 
variability of evolutionary rates across cellular proteins.

Microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) interacts with the regulatory protein 
14-3-3ζ in a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation dependent 
manner. Using selective phosphorylation, calorimetry, nuclear magnetic 
resonance, chemical crosslinking, and X-ray crystallography, we characterized 
interactions of 14-3-3ζ with various binding regions of MAP2c. Although PKA 
phosphorylation increases the affinity of MAP2c for 14-3-3ζ in the proline rich 
region and C-terminal domain, unphosphorylated MAP2c also binds the dimeric 
14-3-3ζ via its microtubule binding domain and variable central domain. 
Monomerization of 14-3-3ζ leads to the loss of affinity for the unphosphorylated 
residues. In neuroblastoma cell extract, MAP2c is heavily phosphorylated by PKA 
and the proline kinase ERK2. Although 14-3-3ζ dimer or monomer do not interact 
with the residues phosphorylated by ERK2, ERK2 phosphorylation of MAP2c in the 
C-terminal domain reduces the binding of MAP2c to both oligomeric variants of 
14-3-3ζ.

O-GlcNAcylation plays critical roles in the regulation of protein functions and 
cellular activities, including protein interactions with other macromolecules. 
While the formation of biomolecular condensates (or biocondensates) regulated by 
O-GlcNAcylation in a few individual proteins has been reported, systematic 
investigation of O-GlcNAcylation on the regulation of biocondensate formation 
remains to be explored. Here we systematically study the roles of 
O-GlcNAcylation in regulating protein solubility and its impacts on RNA-protein 
condensates using mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomics. Unexpectedly, we 
observe a system-wide decrease in the solubility of proteins modified by 
O-GlcNAcylation, with glycoproteins involved in focal adhesion and actin binding 
exhibiting the most significant decrease. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation sites 
located in disordered regions and with fewer acidic and aromatic residues nearby 
are related to a greater drop in protein solubility. Additionally, we discover 
that a specific group of O-GlcNAcylation events promotes the dissociation of 
RNA-protein condensates under heat stress, while some enhance the formation of 
RNA-protein condensates during the recovery phase. Using site mutagenesis, 
inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase, and fluorescence microscopy, we validate 
that O-GlcNAcylation regulates the formation of biocondensates for YTHDF3 and 
NUFIP2. This work advances our understanding of the functions of protein 
O-GlcNAcylation and its roles in the formation of biomolecular condensates.

The assembly of heteromeric protein complexes is an inherently stochastic 
process in which multiple genes are expressed separately into proteins, which 
must then somehow find each other within the cell. Here, we considered one of 
the ways by which prokaryotic organisms have attempted to maximize the 
efficiency of protein complex assembly: the organization of subunit-encoding 
genes into operons. Using structure-based assembly predictions, we show that 
operon gene order has been optimized to match the order in which protein 
subunits assemble. Exceptions to this are almost entirely highly expressed 
proteins for which assembly is less stochastic and for which precisely ordered 
translation offers less benefit. Overall, these results show that ordered 
protein complex assembly pathways are of significant biological importance and 
represent a major evolutionary constraint on operon gene organization.

How minute pathogenic signals trigger decisive immune responses is a fundamental 
question in biology. Classical signaling often relies on ATP-driven enzymatic 
cascades, but innate immunity frequently employs death fold domain (DFD) 
self-assembly. The energetic basis of this assembly is unknown. Here, we show 
that specific DFDs function as energy reservoirs through metastable 
supersaturation. Characterizing all 109 human DFDs, we identified 
sequence-encoded nucleation barriers specifically in the central adaptors of 
inflammatory signalosomes, allowing them to accumulate far above their 
saturation concentration while remaining soluble and poised for activation. We 
demonstrate that the inflammasome adaptor ASC is constitutively supersaturated 
in vivo, retaining energy to power on-demand cell death. Swapping a 
non-supersaturable DFD in the apoptosome with a supersaturable one sensitized 
cells to sublethal stimuli. Mapping all DFD nucleating interactions revealed 
that supersaturated adaptors are specifically templated by other DFDs in their 
respective pathways, limiting deleterious crosstalk. Across human cell types, 
adaptor supersaturation strongly correlates with cell turnover, implicating this 
thermodynamic principle in the trade-off between immunity and longevity. 
Profiling homologues from fish, sponge, and bacteria, we find nucleation 
barriers to be ancestrally conserved. These findings reveal DFD adaptors as 
biological phase-change materials that function like batteries, storing and 
privatizing energy for life-or-death decisions.

We present a whole-cell fully dynamical kinetic model (WCM) of JCVI-syn3A, a 
minimal cell with a reduced genome of 493 genes that has retained few regulatory 
proteins or small RNAs. Cryo-electron tomograms provide the cell geometry and 
ribosome distributions. Time-dependent behaviors of concentrations and reaction 
fluxes from stochastic-deterministic simulations over a cell cycle reveal how 
the cell balances demands of its metabolism, genetic information processes, and 
growth, and offer insight into the principles of life for this minimal cell. The 
energy economy of each process including active transport of amino acids, 
nucleosides, and ions is analyzed. WCM reveals how emergent imbalances lead to 
slowdowns in the rates of transcription and translation. Integration of 
experimental data is critical in building a kinetic model from which emerges a 
genome-wide distribution of mRNA half-lives, multiple DNA replication events 
that can be compared to qPCR results, and the experimentally observed doubling 
behavior.

Protein O-GlcNAcylation plays critical roles in many cellular events, and its 
dysregulation is related to multiple diseases. Integrating bioorthogonal 
chemistry and multiplexed proteomics, we systematically and site specifically 
study the distributions and dynamics of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the nucleus 
and the cytoplasm of human cells. The results demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylated 
proteins with different functions have distinct distribution patterns. The 
distributions vary site specifically, indicating that different glycoforms of 
the same protein may have different distributions. Moreover, we comprehensively 
analyze the dynamics of O-GlcNAcylated and non-modified proteins in these two 
compartments, respectively, and the half-lives of glycoproteins in different 
compartments are markedly different, with the median half-life in the cytoplasm 
being much longer. In addition, glycoproteins in the nucleus are more 
dramatically stabilized than those in the cytoplasm under the O-GlcNAcase 
inhibition. The comprehensive spatial and temporal analyses of protein 
O-GlcNAcylation provide valuable information and advance our understanding of 
this important modification.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) secretes numerous proteins to interfere with 
host immune response for its long-term survival. As one of the top abundant M.tb 
secreted proteins, Rv3722c was found to be essential for bacilli growth. 
However, it remains elusive how this protein interferes with the host immune 
response and regulates M.tb survival. Here, we confirmed that Rv3722c interacted 
with host TRAF3 to promote M.tb replication in macrophages. Knock-down of TRAF3 
attenuated the effect of Rv3722c on the intracellular M.tb survival. The 
interaction between Rv3722c and TRAF3 hampered MAPK and NF-κB pathways, 
resulting in a significant increase of IFN-β expression and decrease of IL-1β, 
IL-6, IL-12p40, and TNF-α expression. Our study revealed that Rv3722c interacted 
with TRAF3 and interrupted its downstream pathways to promote M.tb survival in 
macrophages. These findings facilitate further understanding of the mechanism of 
M.tb secreted proteins in regulating the host cell immune response and promoting 
its intracellular survival.

Prokaryote genomes exhibit a wide range of GC contents and codon usages, both 
resulting from an interaction between mutational bias and natural selection. In 
order to investigate the basis underlying specific codon changes, we performed a 
comprehensive analysis of 29 different prokaryote families. The analysis of core 
gene sets with increasing ancestries in each family lineage revealed that the 
codon usages became progressively more adapted to the tRNA pools. While, as 
previously reported, highly expressed genes presented the most optimized codon 
usage, the singletons contained the less selectively favored codons. The results 
showed that usually codons with the highest translational adaptation were 
preferentially enriched. In agreement with previous reports, a C bias in 2- to 
3-fold pyrimidine-ending codons, and a U bias in 4-fold codons occurred in all 
families, irrespective of the global genomic GC content. Furthermore, the U 
biases suggested that U3-mRNA-U34-tRNA interactions were responsible for a 
prominent codon optimization in both the most ancestral core and the highly 
expressed genes. A comparative analysis of sequences that encode conserved (cr) 
or variable (vr) translated products, with each one being under high (HEP) and 
low (LEP) expression levels, demonstrated that the efficiency was more relevant 
(by a factor of 2) than accuracy to modeling codon usage. Finally, analysis of 
the third position of codons (GC3) revealed that in genomes with global GC 
contents higher than 35 to 40%, selection favored a GC3 increase, whereas in 
genomes with very low GC contents, a decrease in GC3 occurred. A comprehensive 
final model is presented in which all patterns of codon usage variations are 
condensed in four distinct behavioral groups.IMPORTANCE The prokaryotic 
genomes-the current heritage of the most ancient life forms on earth-are 
comprised of diverse gene sets, all characterized by varied origins, ancestries, 
and spatial-temporal expression patterns. Such genetic diversity has for a long 
time raised the question of how cells shape their coding strategies to optimize 
protein demands (i.e., product abundance) and accuracy (i.e., translation 
fidelity) through the use of the same genetic code in genomes with GC contents 
that range from less than 20 to more than 80%. Here, we present evidence on how 
codon usage is adjusted in the prokaryotic tree of life and on how specific 
biases have operated to improve translation. Through the use of proteome data, 
we characterized conserved and variable sequence domains in genes of either high 
or low expression level and quantitated the relative weight of efficiency and 
accuracy-as well as their interaction-in shaping codon usage in prokaryotes.

The genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) is a powerful tool for interpreting and 
predicting cellular phenotypes under various environmental and genetic 
perturbations. However, GEM only considers stoichiometric constraints, and the 
simulated growth and product yield values will show a monotonic linear increase 
with increasing substrate uptake rate, which deviates from the experimentally 
measured values. Recently, the integration of enzymatic constraints into 
stoichiometry-based GEMs was proven to be effective in making novel discoveries 
and predicting new engineering targets. Here, we present the first genome-scale 
enzyme-constrained model (ecCGL1) for Corynebacterium glutamicum reconstructed 
by integrating enzyme kinetic data from various sources using a ECMpy workflow 
based on the high-quality GEM of C. glutamicum (obtained by modifying the iCW773 
model). The enzyme-constrained model improved the prediction of phenotypes and 
simulated overflow metabolism, while also recapitulating the trade-off between 
biomass yield and enzyme usage efficiency. Finally, we used the ecCGL1 to 
identify several gene modification targets for l-lysine production, most of 
which agree with previously reported genes. This study shows that incorporating 
enzyme kinetic information into the GEM enhances the cellular phenotypes 
prediction of C. glutamicum, which can help identify key enzymes and thus 
provide reliable guidance for metabolic engineering.

In the base excision repair pathway, the initiating enzymes, DNA glycosylases, 
remove damaged bases and form long-living complexes with the abasic DNA product, 
but can be displaced by AP endonucleases. However, many nuclear proteins can 
move along DNA, either actively (such as DNA or RNA polymerases) or by passive 
one-dimensional diffusion. In most cases, it is not clear whether this movement 
is disturbed by other bound proteins or how collisions with moving proteins 
affect the bound proteins, including DNA glycosylases. We have used a 
two-substrate system to study the displacement of human OGG1 and NEIL1 DNA 
glycosylases by DNA polymerases in both elongation and diffusion mode and by D4, 
a passively diffusing subunit of a viral DNA polymerase. The OGG1-DNA product 
complex was disrupted by DNA polymerase β (POLβ) in both elongation and 
diffusion mode, Klenow fragment (KF) in the elongation mode and by D4. NEIL1, 
which has a shorter half-life on DNA, was displaced more efficiently. Hence, 
both possibly specific interactions with POLβ and nonspecific collisions (KF, 
D4) can displace DNA glycosylases from DNA. The protein movement along DNA was 
blocked by very tightly bound Cas9 RNA-targeted nuclease, providing an upper 
limit on the efficiency of obstacle clearance.

Unique Shine-Dalgarno Sequences in Cyanobacteria and Chloroplasts Reveal 
Evolutionary Differences in Their Translation Initiation.

Microorganisms require efficient translation to grow and replicate rapidly, and 
translation is often rate-limited by initiation. A prominent feature that 
facilitates translation initiation in bacteria is the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) 
sequence. However, there is much debate over its conservation in Cyanobacteria 
and in chloroplasts which presumably originated from endosymbiosis of ancient 
Cyanobacteria. Elucidating the utilization of SD sequences in Cyanobacteria and 
in chloroplasts is therefore important to understand whether 1) SD role in 
Cyanobacterial translation has been reduced prior to chloroplast endosymbiosis 
or 2) translation in Cyanobacteria and in plastid has been subjected to 
different evolutionary pressures. To test these alternatives, we employed 
genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data to trace differences in SD usage 
among Synechocystis species, Microcystis aeruginosa, cyanophages, Nicotiana 
tabacum chloroplast, and Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast. We corrected their 
mis-annotated 16S rRNA 3' terminus using an RNA-Seq-based approach to determine 
their SD/anti-SD locational constraints using an improved measurement DtoStart. 
We found that cyanophages well-mimic Cyanobacteria in SD usage because both have 
been under the same selection pressure for SD-mediated initiation. Whereas 
chloroplasts lost this similarity because the need for SD-facilitated initiation 
has been reduced in plastids having much reduced genome size and different 
ribosomal proteins as a result of host-symbiont coevolution. Consequently, SD 
sequence significantly increases protein expression in Cyanobacteria but not in 
chloroplasts, and only Cyanobacterial genes compensate for a lack of SD sequence 
by having weaker secondary structures at the 5' UTR. Our results suggest 
different evolutionary pressures operate on translation initiation in 
Cyanobacteria and in chloroplast.

Protein O-GlcNAcylation plays extremely important roles in mammalian cells, 
regulating signal transduction and gene expression. This modification can happen 
during protein translation, and systematic and site-specific analysis of protein 
co-translational O-GlcNAcylation can advance our understanding of this important 
modification. However, it is extraordinarily challenging because normally 
O-GlcNAcylated proteins are very low abundant and the abundances of 
co-translational ones are even much lower. Here, we developed a method 
integrating selective enrichment, a boosting approach, and multiplexed 
proteomics to globally and site-specifically characterize protein 
co-translational O-GlcNAcylation. The boosting approach using the TMT labeling 
dramatically enhances the detection of co-translational glycopeptides with low 
abundance when enriched O-GlcNAcylated peptides from cells with a much longer 
labeling time was used as a boosting sample. More than 180 co-translational 
O-GlcNAcylated proteins were site-specifically identified. Further analyses 
revealed that among co-translational glycoproteins, those related to DNA binding 
and transcription are highly overrepresented using the total identified 
O-GlcNAcylated proteins in the same cells as the background. Compared with the 
glycosylation sites on all glycoproteins, co-translational sites have different 
local structures and adjacent amino acid residues. Overall, an integrative 
method was developed to identify protein co-translational O-GlcNAcylation, which 
is very useful to advance our understanding of this important modification.

BACKGROUND: The endosymbiosis of the bacterial progenitors of the mitochondrion 
and the chloroplast are landmark events in the evolution of life on Earth. While 
both organelles have retained substantial proteomic and biochemical complexity, 
this complexity is not reflected in the content of their genomes. Instead, the 
organellar genomes encode fewer than 5% of the genes found in living relatives 
of their ancestors. While many of the 95% of missing organellar genes have been 
discarded, others have been transferred to the host nuclear genome through a 
process known as endosymbiotic gene transfer.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that the difference in the per-cell copy number of 
the organellar and nuclear genomes presents an energetic incentive to the cell 
to either delete organellar genes or transfer them to the nuclear genome. We 
show that, for the majority of transferred organellar genes, the energy saved by 
nuclear transfer exceeds the costs incurred from importing the encoded protein 
into the organelle where it can provide its function. Finally, we show that the 
net energy saved by endosymbiotic gene transfer can constitute an appreciable 
proportion of total cellular energy budgets and is therefore sufficient to 
impart a selectable advantage to the cell.
CONCLUSION: Thus, reduced cellular cost and improved energy efficiency likely 
played a role in the reductive evolution of mitochondrial and chloroplast 
genomes and the transfer of organellar genes to the nuclear genome.

The tRNA adaptation index (tAI) is a translation efficiency metric that 
considers weighted values (S ij values) for codon-tRNA wobble interaction 
efficiencies. The initial implementation of the tAI had significant flaws. For 
instance, generated S ij weights were optimized based on gene expression in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is expected to vary among different species. 
Consequently, a species-specific approach (stAI) was developed to overcome those 
limitations. However, the stAI method employed a hill climbing algorithm to 
optimize the S ij weights, which is not ideal for obtaining the best set of S ij 
weights because it could struggle to find the global maximum given a complex 
search space, even after using different starting positions. In addition, it did 
not perform well in computing the tAI of fungal genomes in comparison with the 
original implementation. We developed a novel approach named genetic tAI (gtAI) 
implemented as a Python package (https://github.com/AliYoussef96/gtAI), which 
employs a genetic algorithm to obtain the best set of S ij weights and follows a 
new codon usage-based workflow that better computes the tAI of genomes from the 
three domains of life. The gtAI has significantly improved the correlation with 
the codon adaptation index (CAI) and the prediction of protein abundance 
(empirical data) compared to the stAI.

When exposed to stressful conditions, eukaryotic cells respond by inducing the 
formation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes called stress granules. 
Here, we use C. elegans to study two proteins that are important for stress 
granule assembly in human cells - PQN-59, the human UBAP2L ortholog, and GTBP-1, 
the human G3BP1 and G3BP2 ortholog. Both proteins assemble into stress granules 
in the embryo and in the germline when C. elegans is exposed to stressful 
conditions. Neither of the two proteins is essential for the assembly of 
stress-induced granules, as shown by the single and combined depletions by RNAi, 
and neither pqn-59 nor gtbp-1 mutant embryos show higher sensitivity to stress 
than control embryos. We find that pqn-59 mutants display reduced progeny and a 
high percentage of embryonic lethality, phenotypes that are not dependent on 
stress exposure and that are not shared with gtbp-1 mutants. Our data indicate 
that, in contrast to human cells, PQN-59 and GTBP-1 are not required for stress 
granule formation but that PQN-59 is important for C. elegans development.

The cell division cycle in eukaryotic cells is a series of highly coordinated 
molecular interactions that ensure that cell growth, duplication of genetic 
material, and actual cell division are precisely orchestrated to give rise to 
two viable progeny cells. Moreover, the cell cycle machinery is responsible for 
incorporating information about external cues or internal processes that the 
cell must keep track of to ensure a coordinated, timely progression of all 
related processes. This is most pronounced in multicellular organisms, but also 
a cardinal feature in model organisms such as baker's yeast. The complex and 
integrative behavior is difficult to grasp and requires mathematical modeling to 
fully understand the quantitative interplay of the single components within the 
entire system. Here, we present a self-oscillating mathematical model of the 
yeast cell cycle that comprises all major cyclins and their main regulators. 
Furthermore, it accounts for the regulation of the cell cycle machinery by a 
series of external stimuli such as mating pheromones and changes in osmotic 
pressure or nutrient quality. We demonstrate how the external perturbations 
modify the dynamics of cell cycle components and how the cell cycle resumes 
after adaptation to or relief from stress.

Codon composition, GC content and local RNA secondary structures can have a 
profound effect on gene expression, and mutations affecting these parameters, 
even though they do not alter the protein sequence, are not neutral in terms of 
selection. Although evidence exists that, in some cases, selection favours more 
stable RNA secondary structures, we currently lack a concrete idea of how many 
genes are affected within a species, and whether this is a universal phenomenon 
in nature. We searched for signs of structural selection in a global manner, 
analysing a set of 1 million coding sequences from 73 species representing all 
domains of life, as well as viruses, by means of our newly developed software 
PACKEIS. We show that codon composition and amino acid identity are main 
determinants of RNA secondary structure. In addition, we show that the 
arrangement of synonymous codons within coding sequences is non-random, yielding 
extremely high, but also extremely low, RNA structuredness significantly more 
often than expected by chance. Taken together, we demonstrate that selection for 
high and low levels of secondary structure is a widespread phenomenon. Our 
results provide another line of evidence that synonymous mutations are less 
neutral than commonly thought, which is of importance for many evolutionary 
models.

Whereas the rate of gene duplication is relatively high, only certain 
duplications survive the filter of natural selection and can contribute to 
genome evolution. However, the reasons why certain genes can be retained after 
duplication whereas others cannot remain largely unknown. Many proteins contain 
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), whose structures fluctuate between 
alternative conformational states. Due to their high flexibility, IDRs often 
enable protein-protein interactions and are the target of post-translational 
modifications. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have characteristics 
that might either stimulate or hamper the retention of their encoding genes 
after duplication. On the one hand, IDRs may enable functional diversification, 
thus promoting duplicate retention. On the other hand, increased IDP 
availability is expected to result in deleterious unspecific interactions. Here, 
we interrogate the proteomes of human, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis 
elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana and Escherichia coli, in 
order to ascertain the impact of protein intrinsic disorder on gene 
duplicability. We show that, in general, proteins encoded by duplicated genes 
tend to be less disordered than those encoded by singletons. The only exception 
is proteins encoded by ohnologs, which tend to be more disordered than those 
encoded by singletons or genes resulting from small-scale duplications. Our 
results indicate that duplication of genes encoding IDPs outside the context of 
whole-genome duplication (WGD) is often deleterious, but that IDRs facilitate 
retention of duplicates in the context of WGD. We discuss the potential 
evolutionary implications of our results.

Adaptation of infections and hosts has resulted in several metabolic mechanisms 
adopted by intracellular pathogens to combat the defense responses and the lack 
of fuel during infection. Human tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (MTB) is the world's first cause of mortality tied to a single 
disease. This study aims to characterize and anticipate potential antigen 
characteristics for promising vaccine candidates for the hypothetical protein of 
MTB through computational strategies. The protein is associated with the 
catalyzation of dithiol oxidation and/or disulfide reduction because of the 
protein's anticipated disulfide oxidoreductase properties. This investigation 
analyzed the protein's physicochemical characteristics, protein-protein 
interactions, subcellular locations, anticipated active sites, secondary and 
tertiary structures, allergenicity, antigenicity, and toxicity properties. The 
protein has significant active amino acid residues with no allergenicity, 
elevated antigenicity, and no toxicity.

Significant recent advances in structural biology, particularly in the field of 
cryoelectron microscopy, have dramatically expanded our ability to create 
structural models of proteins and protein complexes. However, many proteins 
remain refractory to these approaches because of their low abundance, low 
stability, or-in the case of complexes-simply not having yet been analyzed. 
Here, we demonstrate the power of using cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) 
for the high-throughput experimental assessment of the structures of proteins 
and protein complexes. This included those produced by high-resolution but 
in vitro experimental data, as well as in silico predictions based on amino acid 
sequence alone. We present the largest XL-MS dataset to date, describing 28,910 
unique residue pairs captured across 4,084 unique human proteins and 2,110 
unique protein-protein interactions. We show that models of proteins and their 
complexes predicted by AlphaFold2, and inspired and corroborated by the XL-MS 
data, offer opportunities to deeply mine the structural proteome and interactome 
and reveal mechanisms underlying protein structure and function.

Small RNAs (sRNAs) play a crucial role in the regulation of bacterial gene 
expression by silencing the translation of target mRNAs. SgrS is an sRNA that 
relieves glucose-phosphate stress, or "sugar shock" in E. coli. The power of 
single cell measurements is their ability to obtain population level statistics 
that illustrate cell-to-cell variation. Here, we utilize single molecule 
super-resolution microscopy in single E. coli cells coupled with stochastic 
modeling to analyze glucose-phosphate stress regulation by SgrS. We present a 
kinetic model that captures the combined effects of transcriptional regulation, 
gene replication and chaperone mediated RNA silencing in the SgrS regulatory 
network. This more complete kinetic description, simulated stochastically, 
recapitulates experimentally observed cellular heterogeneity and characterizes 
the binding of SgrS to the chaperone protein Hfq as a slow process that not only 
stabilizes SgrS but also may be critical in restructuring the sRNA to facilitate 
association with its target ptsG mRNA.

The fidelity of signal transduction requires the binding of regulatory molecules 
to their cognate targets. However, the crowded cell interior risks off-target 
interactions between proteins that are functionally unrelated. How such 
off-target interactions impact fitness is not generally known. Here, we use 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to inducibly express tyrosine kinases. Because yeast 
lacks bona fide tyrosine kinases, the resulting tyrosine phosphorylation is 
biologically spurious. We engineered 44 yeast strains each expressing a tyrosine 
kinase, and quantitatively analysed their phosphoproteomes. This analysis 
resulted in ~30,000 phosphosites mapping to ~3500 proteins. The number of 
spurious pY sites generated correlates strongly with decreased growth, and we 
predict over 1000 pY events to be deleterious. However, we also find that many 
of the spurious pY sites have a negligible effect on fitness, possibly because 
of their low stoichiometry. This result is consistent with our evolutionary 
analyses demonstrating a lack of phosphotyrosine counter-selection in species 
with tyrosine kinases. Our results suggest that, alongside the risk for 
toxicity, the cell can tolerate a large degree of non-functional crosstalk as 
interaction networks evolve.

Codon bias analysis of SARS-CoV-2 reveals suboptimal adaptation for translation 
in human cells it infects. The detailed examination of the codons preferentially 
used by SARS-CoV-2 shows a strong preference for LysAAA, GlnCAA, GluGAA, and 
ArgAGA, which are infrequently used in human genes. In the absence of an adapted 
tRNA pool, efficient decoding of these codons requires a 
5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2) modification at the U34 wobble 
position of the corresponding tRNAs (tLysUUU; tGlnUUG; tGluUUC; tArgUCU). The 
optimal translation of SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORFs) may therefore 
require several adjustments to the host's translation machinery, enabling the 
highly biased viral genome to achieve a more favorable "Ready-to-Translate" 
state in human cells. Experimental approaches based on LC-MS/MS quantification 
of tRNA modifications and on alteration of enzymatic tRNA modification pathways 
provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 induces U34 
tRNA modifications and relies on these modifications for its lifecycle. The 
conclusions emphasize the need for future studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 
codon bias and its ability to alter the host tRNA pool through the manipulation 
of RNA modifications.

Coenzyme Q (Q) is a key lipid electron transporter, but several aspects of its 
biosynthesis and redox homeostasis remain undefined. Various flavoproteins 
reduce ubiquinone (oxidized form of Q) to ubiquinol (QH2); however, in 
eukaryotes, only oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex III (CIII) oxidizes 
QH2 to Q. The mechanism of action of CIII is still debated. Herein, we show that 
the Q reductase electron-transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH) is 
essential for CIII activity in skeletal muscle. We identify a complex 
(comprising ETFDH, CIII and the Q-biosynthesis regulator COQ2) that directs 
electrons from lipid substrates to the respiratory chain, thereby reducing 
electron leaks and reactive oxygen species production. This metabolon maintains 
total Q levels, minimizes QH2-reductive stress and improves OXPHOS efficiency. 
Muscle-specific Etfdh-/- mice develop myopathy due to CIII dysfunction, 
indicating that ETFDH is a required OXPHOS component and a potential therapeutic 
target for mitochondrial redox medicine.

The availability of an increasingly large amount of public proteomics data sets 
presents an opportunity for performing combined analyses to generate 
comprehensive organism-wide protein expression maps across different organisms 
and biological conditions. Sus scrofa, a domestic pig, is a model organism 
relevant for food production and for human biomedical research. Here, we 
reanalyzed 14 public proteomics data sets from the PRIDE database coming from 
pig tissues to assess baseline (without any biological perturbation) protein 
abundance in 14 organs, encompassing a total of 20 healthy tissues from 128 
samples. The analysis involved the quantification of protein abundance in 599 
mass spectrometry runs. We compared protein expression patterns among different 
pig organs and examined the distribution of proteins across these organs. Then, 
we studied how protein abundances were compared across different data sets and 
studied the tissue specificity of the detected proteins. Of particular interest, 
we conducted a comparative analysis of protein expression between pig and human 
tissues, revealing a high degree of correlation in protein expression among 
orthologs, particularly in brain, kidney, heart, and liver samples. We have 
integrated the protein expression results into the Expression Atlas resource for 
easy access and visualization of the protein expression data individually or 
alongside gene expression data.

Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are endogenous DNA lesions widespread in human 
cells. Having no nucleobases, they are noncoding and promutagenic. AP site 
repair is generally initiated through strand incision by AP endonuclease 1 
(APE1). Although AP sites' repair in regular B-DNA has been studied extensively, 
their processing in G-quadruplexes (G4s) has received much less attention. Here, 
we used the hTERT promoter region that is capable of forming three stacked 
parallel G4s to understand how AP sites can influence higher-order quadruplex 
folding and stability and how a G4 affects the efficiency of human APE1-mediated 
AP site processing. We designed a series of synthetic single- and 
double-stranded DNA constructs of varying lengths containing a stable AP site 
analog in both G- and C-rich strands at positions corresponding to somatic 
driver mutations. Using circular dichroism, we studied the effect of the AP site 
on hTERT G4 structure and stability. Bio-layer interferometry and gel-based 
approaches were employed to characterize APE1 binding to the designed DNA 
substrates and AP site processing. It was shown that (i) an AP site leads to G4 
destabilization, which depends on the lesion location in the G4 scaffold; (ii) 
APE1 binds tightly to hTERT G4 structure but exhibits greatly reduced cleavage 
activity at AP sites embedded in the quadruplex; and (iii) a clear correlation 
was revealed between AP site-induced hTERT G4 destabilization and APE1 activity. 
We can hypothesize that reduced repair of AP sites in the hTERT G4 is one of the 
reasons for the high mutation rate in this promoter region.

In the search for potential mechanisms underlying the remarkable resistance of 
healthy skin against infection by soil bacteria like Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa 
we identified fragments of the intrinsically disordered protein hornerin as 
potent microbicidal agents in the stratum corneum. We found that, independent of 
the amino acid (AA)-sequence, any tested linear cationic peptide containing a 
high percentage of disorder-promoting AA and a low percentage of order-promoting 
AA is a potent microbicidal antimicrobial. We further show that the 
antimicrobial activity of these cationic intrinsically disordered antimicrobial 
peptides (CIDAMPs) depends on the peptide chain length, its net charge, 
lipidation and environmental conditions. The ubiquitous presence of latent 
CIDAMP sources in nature suggests a common and yet overlooked adapted innate 
disinfection system of body surfaces. The simple structure and virtually any 
imaginable sequence or composition of disorder-promoting AA allow the generation 
of a plethora of CIDAMPs. These are potential novel microbicidal anti-infectives 
for various bacterial pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and fungal pathogens like Candida albicans and 
Cryptococcus neoformans.

Existing high-throughput methods to identify RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are 
based on capture of polyadenylated RNAs and cannot recover proteins that 
interact with nonadenylated RNAs, including long noncoding RNA, pre-mRNAs and 
bacterial RNAs. We present orthogonal organic phase separation (OOPS), which 
does not require molecular tagging or capture of polyadenylated RNA, and apply 
it to recover cross-linked protein-RNA and free protein, or protein-bound RNA 
and free RNA, in an unbiased way. We validated OOPS in HEK293, U2OS and MCF10A 
human cell lines, and show that 96% of proteins recovered were bound to RNA. We 
show that all long RNAs can be cross-linked to proteins, and recovered 1,838 
RBPs, including 926 putative novel RBPs. OOPS is approximately 100-fold more 
efficient than existing methods and can enable analyses of dynamic RNA-protein 
interactions. We also characterize dynamic changes in RNA-protein interactions 
in mammalian cells following nocodazole arrest, and present a bacterial 
RNA-interactome for Escherichia coli. OOPS is compatible with downstream 
proteomics and RNA sequencing, and can be applied in any organism.

Diminished bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) contributes to the pathogenesis 
of cardiometabolic disorders. However, the alterations in signaling under NO 
deficiency remain mostly unknown. We combined genetics and proteomics to 
quantify changes in the heart proteome, phosphoproteome, and S-nitrosocysteine 
proteome in mice lacking nitric oxide synthases (NOS1, NOS2, NOS3), lacking all 
three enzymes (tNOS), or the alpha 1-regulatory subunit of the soluble guanylate 
cyclase (sGCα1). Modest changes of less than 1% in the proteome and 4% in the 
phosphoproteome in single NOS gene or sGCα1 null mouse hearts indicate 
sufficient biological compensation. In contrast, the number of S-nitrosylated 
proteins declined by 80%, 57%, and 35% in NOS3, NOS1, and NOS2 null mice, 
respectively. A 21% remodeling of the proteome and 9% of the phosphoproteome in 
the tNOS null mice included integral kinases that provide adaptive rewiring of 
signaling. The data revealed the emergence of enhanced mitogen-activated-kinases 
Mapk3/Mapk1 signaling, documented by increased phosphorylation of these kinases 
and their downstream targets. The data highlight that adaptive compensation of 
signaling prevents overt phenotypes during NO signaling deficits. In contrast, 
maladaptive signaling via Mapk3/Mapk1 may promote pathological cardiomyopathy 
that progressively develops in the tNOS null mice.

The developing mammalian heart undergoes an important metabolic shift from 
glycolysis towards mitochondrial oxidation that is critical to support the 
increasing energetic demands of the maturing heart. Here, we describe a new 
mechanistic link between mitochondria and cardiac morphogenesis, uncovered by 
studying mitochondrial citrate carrier (SLC25A1) knockout mice. Slc25a1 null 
embryos displayed impaired growth, mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac 
malformations that recapitulate the congenital heart defects observed in 22q11.2 
deletion syndrome, a microdeletion disorder involving the SLC25A1 locus. 
Importantly, Slc25a1 heterozygous embryos, while overtly indistinguishable from 
wild type, exhibited an increased frequency of these defects, suggesting Slc25a1 
haploinsuffiency and dose-dependent effects. Mechanistically, SLC25A1 may link 
mitochondria to transcriptional regulation of metabolism through epigenetic 
control of gene expression to promote metabolic remodeling in the developing 
heart. Collectively, this work positions SLC25A1 as a novel mitochondrial 
regulator of cardiac morphogenesis and metabolic maturation, and suggests a role 
in congenital heart disease.

The amino acid composition of a protein influences its expression.

Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom.

The quantity of each protein in a cell only is only partially correlated with 
its gene transcription rate. Independent influences on protein synthesis levels 
include mRNA sequence motifs, amino acyl-tRNA synthesis levels, elongation 
factor action, and protein susceptibility to degradation. Here we report that 
the amino acid composition of a protein can also influence its expression level 
in two distinct ways. The nutritional classification of amino acids in animals 
reflects their potential for scarcity-essential amino acids (EAA) are reliant on 
dietary supply, non-essential amino acids (NEAA) from internal biosynthesis, and 
conditionally essential amino acids (CEAA) from both. Accessing public proteomic 
datasets, we demonstrate that a protein's CEAA sequence composition is inversely 
correlated with expression-a correlation enhanced during rapid cellular 
proliferation-suggesting CEAA availability can limit translation. Similarly, 
proteins with the most extreme compositions of EAA are generally reduced in 
abundance. These latter proteins participate in biological systems such as taste 
and food-seeking behaviour, oxidative phosphorylation, and chemokine function, 
and so linking their expression to EAA availability may act as a homeostatic 
response to malnutrition. Protein composition can also influence general human 
phenotypes and disease susceptibility: stature proteins are enriched in CEAAs, 
and a curated dataset of over 700 cancer proteins is significantly 
under-represented in EAAs. We also show that individual amino acids can 
influence protein expression across all kingdoms of life and that this effect 
appears to be rooted in the unchanging structural and mRNA encoding features of 
each amino acid. Species-specific environmental survival pathways are shown to 
be enriched in proteins with individual amino acid compositions favouring higher 
expression. These two forms of amino acid-driven protein expression regulation 
promise new insights into systems biology, evolutionary studies, experimental 
research design, and public health intervention.

The process of drug design requires the initial identification of compounds that 
bind their targets with high affinity and selectivity. Advances in generative 
modeling of small molecules based on deep learning are offering novel 
opportunities for making this process faster and cheaper. Here, we propose an 
approach to achieve this goal, where predictions of binding affinity are used in 
conjunction with the Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JTVAE) whose latent 
space is used to facilitate the efficient exploration of the chemical space 
using a Bayesian optimization strategy. The exploration identifies small 
molecules predicted to have both high affinity and high selectivity by using an 
objective function that optimizes the binding to the target while penalizing the 
binding to off-targets. The framework is demonstrated for FMS-like tyrosine 
kinase 3 (FLT3) and shown to predict small molecules with predicted affinity and 
selectivity comparable to those of clinically approved drugs for this target.

Heterologous protein expression is an important method for analysing cellular 
functions of proteins, in genetic circuit engineering and in overexpressing 
proteins for biopharmaceutical applications and structural biology research. The 
degeneracy of the genetic code, which enables a single protein to be encoded by 
a multitude of synonymous gene sequences, plays an important role in regulating 
protein expression, but substantial uncertainty exists concerning the details of 
this phenomenon. Here we analyse the influence of a profiled codon usage 
adaptation approach on protein expression levels in the eukaryotic model 
organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We selected green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
and human α-synuclein (αSyn) as representatives for stable and intrinsically 
disordered proteins and representing a benchmark and a challenging test case. A 
new approach was implemented to design typical genes resembling the codon usage 
of any subset of endogenous genes. Using this approach, synthetic genes for GFP 
and αSyn were generated, heterologously expressed and evaluated in yeast. We 
demonstrate that GFP is expressed at high levels, and that the toxic αSyn can be 
adapted to endogenous, low-level expression. The new software is publicly 
available as a web-application for performing host-specific protein adaptations 
to a set of the most commonly used model organisms ( 
https://odysseus.motorprotein.de ).

The vast amount of experimental data from recent advances in the field of 
high-throughput biology begs for integration into more complex data structures 
such as genome-wide functional association networks. Such networks have been 
used for elucidation of the interplay of intra-cellular molecules to make 
advances ranging from the basic science understanding of evolutionary processes 
to the more translational field of precision medicine. The allure of the field 
has resulted in rapid growth of the number of available network resources, each 
with unique attributes exploitable to answer different biological questions. 
Unfortunately, the high volume of network resources makes it impossible for the 
intended user to select an appropriate tool for their particular research 
question. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the underlying data 
and representative network resources as well as to mention methods of 
integration, allowing a customized approach to resource selection. Additionally, 
this report will provide a primer for researchers venturing into the field of 
network integration.

Adoptive cell therapies continually evolve through science-based innovation. 
Specialized innovations for TCR-T therapies are described here that are embedded 
in an End-to-End Platform for TCR-T Therapy Development which aims to provide 
solutions for key unmet patient needs by addressing challenges of TCR-T therapy, 
including selection of target antigens and suitable T cell receptors, generation 
of TCR-T therapies that provide long term, durable efficacy and safety and 
development of efficient and scalable production of patient-specific 
(personalized) TCR-T therapy for solid tumors. Multiple, combinable, innovative 
technologies are used in a systematic and sequential manner in the development 
of TCR-T therapies. One group of technologies encompasses product enhancements 
that enable TCR-T therapies to be safer, more specific and more effective. The 
second group of technologies addresses development optimization that supports 
discovery and development processes for TCR-T therapies to be performed more 
quickly, with higher quality and greater efficiency. Each module incorporates 
innovations layered onto basic technologies common to the field of immunology. 
An active approach of "evolution by innovation" supports the overall goal to 
develop best-in-class TCR-T therapies for treatment of patients with solid 
cancer.

Manipulation of protein synthesis is commonly applied to uncover protein 
functions and cellular activities. Multiple inhibitors with distinct mechanisms 
have been widely investigated and employed in bio-related research, but it is 
extraordinarily challenging to measure and evaluate the synthesis inhibition 
efficiencies of individual proteins by different inhibitors at the proteome 
level. Newly synthesized proteins are the immediate and direct products of 
protein synthesis, and thus their comprehensive quantification provides a unique 
opportunity to study protein inhibition. Here, we systematically investigate 
protein inhibition and evaluate different popular inhibitors, i.e. 
cycloheximide, puromycin, and anisomycin, through global quantification of newly 
synthesized proteins in several types of human cells (A549, MCF-7, Jurkat, and 
THP-1 cells). The inhibition efficiencies of protein synthesis are 
comprehensively measured by integrating azidohomoalanine-based protein labeling, 
selective enrichment, a boosting approach, and multiplexed proteomics. The same 
inhibitor results in dramatic variation of the synthesis inhibition efficiencies 
for different proteins in the same cells, and each inhibitor exhibits unique 
preferences. Besides cell type- and inhibitor-specific effects, some universal 
rules are unraveled. For instance, nucleolar and ribosomal proteins have 
relatively higher inhibition efficiencies in every type of cells treated with 
each inhibitor. Moreover, proteins intrinsically resistant or sensitive to the 
inhibition are identified and found to have distinct functions. Systematic 
investigation of protein synthesis inhibition in several types of human cells by 
different inhibitors provides valuable information about the inhibition of 
protein synthesis, advancing our understanding of inhibiting protein synthesis.

Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) was introduced more than five decades ago with 
secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and a decade later with laser 
desorption/ionization (LDI) mass spectrometry (MS). Large biomolecule imaging by 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) was developed in the 1990s 
and ambient laser MS a decade ago. Although SIMS has been capable of imaging 
with a moderate mass range at sub-micrometer lateral resolution from its 
inception, laser MS requires additional effort to achieve a lateral resolution 
of 10μm or below which is required to image at the size scale of single 
mammalian cells. This review covers untargeted large biomolecule MSI using 
lasers for desorption/ionization or laser desorption and post-ionization. These 
methods include laser microprobe (LDI) MSI, MALDI MSI, laser ambient and 
atmospheric pressure MSI, and near-field laser ablation MS. Novel approaches to 
improving lateral resolution are discussed, including oversampling, beam 
shaping, transmission geometry, reflective and through-hole objectives, 
microscope mode, and near-field optics.

The mammalian cell nucleus is a highly organized organelle that contains 
membrane-less structures referred to as nuclear bodies (NBs). Some NBs carry 
specific RNA types that play architectural roles in their formation. Here, we 
show two types of RNase-sensitive DBC1-containing NBs, DBC1 nuclear body (DNB) 
in HCT116 cells and Sam68 nuclear body (SNB) in HeLa cells, that exhibit 
phase-separated features and are constructed using RNA polymerase I or II 
transcripts in a cell type-specific manner. We identified additional protein 
components present in DNB by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, some of 
which (DBC1 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L [HNRNPL]) are required 
for DNB formation. The rescue experiment using the truncated HNRNPL mutants 
revealed that two RNA-binding domains and intrinsically disordered regions of 
HNRNPL play significant roles in DNB formation. All these domains of HNRNPL 
promote in vitro droplet formation, suggesting the need for multivalent 
interactions between HNRNPL and RNA as well as proteins in DNB formation.

Cytoplasmic dynein-1 (dynein) is a microtubule-associated, minus end-directed 
motor that traffics hundreds of different cargos. Dynein must discriminate 
between cargos and traffic them at the appropriate time from the correct 
cellular region. How dynein's trafficking activity is regulated in time or 
cellular space remains poorly understood. Here, we identify CCSer2 as the first 
known protein to gate dynein activity in the spatial dimension. CCSer2 promotes 
the migration of developing zebrafish primordium cells and of cultured human 
cells by facilitating the trafficking of cargos that are acted on by cortically 
localized dynein. CCSer2 inhibits the interaction between dynein and its 
regulator Ndel1 exclusively at the cell periphery, resulting in localized dynein 
activation. Our findings suggest that the spatial specificity of dynein is 
achieved by the localization of proteins that disinhibit Ndel1. We propose that 
CCSer2 defines a broader class of proteins that activate dynein in distinct 
microenvironments via Ndel1 inhibition.

Eicosanoids are a family of bioactive lipids, including derivatives of the 
ubiquitous fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA). The intimate involvement of 
eicosanoids in inflammation motivates the development of predictive in silico 
models for a systems-level exploration of disease mechanisms, drug development 
and replacement of animal models. Using an ensemble modelling strategy, we 
developed a computational model of the AA cascade. This approach allows the 
visualisation of plausible and thermodynamically feasible predictions, 
overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter modelling. A quality scoring 
method was developed to quantify the accuracy of ensemble predictions relative 
to experimental data, measuring the overall uncertainty of the process. Monte 
Carlo ensemble modelling was used to quantify the prediction confidence levels. 
Model applicability was demonstrated using mass spectrometry mediator lipidomics 
to measure eicosanoids produced by HaCaT epidermal keratinocytes and 46BR.1N 
dermal fibroblasts, treated with stimuli (calcium ionophore A23187), 
(ultraviolet radiation, adenosine triphosphate) and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor 
(indomethacin). Experimentation and predictions were in good qualitative 
agreement, demonstrating the ability of the model to be adapted to cell types 
exhibiting differences in AA release and enzyme concentration profiles. The 
quantitative agreement between experimental and predicted outputs could be 
improved by expanding network topology to include additional reactions. Overall, 
our approach generated an adaptable, tuneable ensemble model of the AA cascade 
that can be tailored to represent different cell types and demonstrated that the 
integration of in silico and in vitro methods can facilitate a greater 
understanding of complex biological networks such as the AA cascade.

Translation of messenger RNAs lacking a stop codon results in the addition of a 
carboxy-terminal poly-lysine tract to the nascent polypeptide, causing ribosome 
stalling. Non-stop proteins and other stalled nascent chains are recognized by 
the ribosome quality control (RQC) machinery and targeted for proteasomal 
degradation. Failure of this process leads to neurodegeneration by unknown 
mechanisms. Here we show that deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p in 
yeast, a key RQC component, causes stalled proteins to form detergent-resistant 
aggregates and inclusions. Aggregation is dependent on a C-terminal 
alanine/threonine tail that is added to stalled polypeptides by the RQC 
component, Rqc2p. Formation of inclusions additionally requires the poly-lysine 
tract present in non-stop proteins. The aggregates sequester multiple cytosolic 
chaperones and thereby interfere with general protein quality control pathways. 
These findings can explain the proteotoxicity of ribosome-stalled polypeptides 
and demonstrate the essential role of the RQC in maintaining proteostasis.

Single-cell RNA sequencing studies on gene co-expression patterns could yield 
important regulatory and functional insights, but have so far been limited by 
the confounding effects of differentiation and cell cycle. We apply a tailored 
experimental design that eliminates these confounders, and report thousands of 
intrinsically covarying gene pairs in mouse embryonic stem cells. These 
covariations form a network with biological properties, outlining known and 
novel gene interactions. We provide the first evidence that miRNAs naturally 
induce transcriptome-wide covariations and compare the relative importance of 
nuclear organization, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in 
defining covariations. We find that nuclear organization has the greatest 
impact, and that genes encoding for physically interacting proteins specifically 
tend to covary, suggesting importance for protein complex formation. Our results 
lend support to the concept of post-transcriptional RNA operons, but we further 
present evidence that nuclear proximity of genes may provide substantial 
functional regulation in mammalian single cells.

Whole-cell computational models aim to predict cellular phenotypes from genotype 
by representing the entire genome, the structure and concentration of each 
molecular species, each molecular interaction, and the extracellular 
environment. Whole-cell models have great potential to transform bioscience, 
bioengineering, and medicine. However, numerous challenges remain to achieve 
whole-cell models. Nevertheless, researchers are beginning to leverage recent 
progress in measurement technology, bioinformatics, data sharing, rule-based 
modeling, and multi-algorithmic simulation to build the first whole-cell models. 
We anticipate that ongoing efforts to develop scalable whole-cell modeling tools 
will enable dramatically more comprehensive and more accurate models, including 
models of human cells.

High soluble protein expression in heterologous hosts is crucial for various 
research and applications. Despite considerable research on the impact of codon 
usage on expression levels, the relationship between protein sequence and 
expression is often overlooked. In this study, a novel connection between 
protein expression and sequence is uncovered, leading to the development of SRAB 
(Strength of Relative Amino Acid Bias) based on AEI (Amino Acid Expression 
Index). The AEI served as an objective measure of this correlation, with higher 
AEI values enhancing soluble expression. Subsequently, the pre-trained protein 
model MP-TRANS (MindSpore Protein Transformer) is developed and fine-tuned using 
transfer learning techniques to create 88 prediction models (MPB-EXP) for 
predicting heterologous expression levels across 88 species. This approach 
achieved an average accuracy of 0.78, surpassing conventional machine learning 
methods. Additionally, a mutant generation model, MPB-MUT, is devised and 
utilized to enhance expression levels in specific hosts. Experimental validation 
demonstrated that the top 3 mutants of xylanase (previously not expressed in 
Escherichia coli) successfully achieved high-level soluble expression in E. 
coli. These findings highlight the efficacy of the developed model in predicting 
and optimizing gene expression based on protein sequences.

Antibody-based research applications are critical for biological discovery. Yet 
there are no industry standards for comparing the performance of antibodies in 
various applications. We describe a knockout cell line-based antibody 
characterization platform, developed and approved jointly by industry and 
academic researchers, that enables the systematic comparison of antibody 
performance in western blot, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. The 
scalable protocols, which require minimal technological resources, consist of 
(1) the identification of appropriate cell lines for antibody characterization 
studies, (2) development/contribution of isogenic knockout controls, and (3) a 
series of antibody characterization procedures focused on the most common 
applications of antibodies in research. We provide examples of expected outcomes 
to guide antibody users in evaluating antibody performance. Central to our 
approach is advocating for transparent and open data sharing, enabling a 
community effort to identify specific antibodies for all human proteins. 
Mid-level graduate students with training in biochemistry and prior experience 
in cell culture and microscopy can complete the protocols for a specific protein 
within 1 month while working part-time on this effort. Antibody characterization 
is needed to meet standards for resource validation and data reproducibility, 
which are increasingly required by journals and funding agencies.

Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is an emerging microbial chassis for biobased chemical 
production from renewable feedstocks and environmental bioremediation. However, 
tools for studying, engineering, and modulating protein complexes and 
biosynthetic enzymes in this organism are largely underdeveloped. Genetic code 
expansion for the incorporation of unnatural amino acids (unAAs) into proteins 
can advance such efforts and, furthermore, enable additional controls of 
biological processes of the strain. In this work, we established the 
orthogonality of two widely used archaeal tRNA synthetase and tRNA pairs in 
KT2440. Following the optimization of decoding systems, four unAAs were 
incorporated into proteins in response to a UAG stop codon at 34.6-78% 
efficiency. In addition, we demonstrated the utility of genetic code expansion 
through the incorporation of a photocross-linking amino acid, 
p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa), into glutathione S-transferase (GstA) and a 
chemosensory response regulator (CheY) for protein-protein interaction studies 
in KT2440. This work reported the successful genetic code expansion in KT2440 
for the first time. Given the diverse structure and functions of unAAs that have 
been added to protein syntheses using the archaeal systems, our research lays 
down a solid foundation for future work to study and enhance the biological 
functions of KT2440.

Abundance Imparts Evolutionary Constraints of Similar Magnitude on the Buried, 
Surface, and Disordered Regions of Proteins.

An understanding of the forces shaping protein conservation is key, both for the 
fundamental knowledge it represents and to allow for optimal use of evolutionary 
information in practical applications. Sequence conservation is typically 
examined at one of two levels. The first is a residue-level, where intra-protein 
differences are analyzed and the second is a protein-level, where inter-protein 
differences are studied. At a residue level, we know that solvent-accessibility 
is a prime determinant of conservation. By inverting this logic, we inferred 
that disordered regions are slightly more solvent-accessible on average than the 
most exposed surface residues in domains. By integrating abundance information 
with evolutionary data within and across proteins, we confirmed a previously 
reported strong surface-core association in the evolution of structured regions, 
but we found a comparatively weak association between disordered and structured 
regions. The facts that disordered and structured regions experience different 
structural constraints and evolve independently provide a unique setup to 
examine an outstanding question: why is a protein's abundance the main 
determinant of its sequence conservation? Indeed, any structural or biophysical 
property linked to the abundance-conservation relationship should increase the 
relative conservation of regions concerned with that property (e.g., disordered 
residues with mis-interactions, domain residues with misfolding). Surprisingly, 
however, we found the conservation of disordered and structured regions to 
increase in equal proportion with abundance. This observation implies that 
either abundance-related constraints are structure-independent, or multiple 
constraints apply to different regions and perfectly balance each other.

Across the Tree of Life (ToL), the complexity of proteomes varies widely. Our 
systematic analysis depicts that from the simplest archaea to mammals, the total 
number of proteins per proteome expanded ∼200-fold. Individual proteins also 
became larger, and multidomain proteins expanded ∼50-fold. Apart from 
duplication and divergence of existing proteins, completely new proteins were 
born. Along the ToL, the number of different folds expanded ∼5-fold and fold 
combinations ∼20-fold. Proteins prone to misfolding and aggregation, such as 
repeat and beta-rich proteins, proliferated ∼600-fold and, accordingly, proteins 
predicted as aggregation-prone became 6-fold more frequent in mammalian compared 
with bacterial proteomes. To control the quality of these expanding proteomes, 
core chaperones, ranging from heat shock proteins 20 (HSP20s) that prevent 
aggregation to HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP100 acting as adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP)-fueled unfolding and refolding machines, also evolved. However, these core 
chaperones were already available in prokaryotes, and they comprise ∼0.3% of all 
genes from archaea to mammals. This challenge-roughly the same number of core 
chaperones supporting a massive expansion of proteomes-was met by 1) elevation 
of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundances of the ancient generalist core 
chaperones in the cell, and 2) continuous emergence of new substrate-binding and 
nucleotide-exchange factor cochaperones that function cooperatively with core 
chaperones as a network.

In eukaryotic organisms, subcellular protein location is critical in defining 
protein function and understanding sub-functionalization of gene families. Some 
proteins have defined locations, whereas others have low specificity targeting 
and complex accumulation patterns. There is no single approach that can be 
considered entirely adequate for defining the in vivo location of all proteins. 
By combining evidence from different approaches, the strengths and weaknesses of 
different technologies can be estimated, and a location consensus can be built. 
The Subcellular Location of Proteins in Arabidopsis database ( http://suba.live/ 
) combines experimental data sets that have been reported in the literature and 
is analyzing these data to provide useful tools for biologists to interpret 
their own data. Foremost among these tools is a consensus classifier (SUBAcon) 
that computes a proposed location for all proteins based on balancing the 
experimental evidence and predictions. Further tools analyze sets of proteins to 
define the abundance of cellular structures. Extending these types of resources 
to plant crop species has been complex due to polyploidy, gene family expansion 
and contraction, and the movement of pathways and processes within cells across 
the plant kingdom. The Crop Proteins of Annotated Location database ( 
http://crop-pal.org/ ) has developed a range of subcellular location resources 
including a species-specific voting consensus for 12 plant crop species that 
offers collated evidence and filters for current crop proteomes akin to SUBA. 
Comprehensive cross-species comparison of these data shows that the sub-cellular 
proteomes (subcellulomes) depend only to some degree on phylogenetic 
relationship and are more conserved in major biosynthesis than in metabolic 
pathways. Together SUBA and cropPAL created reference subcellulomes for plants 
as well as species-specific subcellulomes for cross-species data mining. These 
data collections are increasingly used by the research community to provide a

The auxin-inducible degradation system has been widely adopted in the 
Caenorhabditis elegans research community for its ability to empirically control 
the spatiotemporal expression of target proteins. This system can efficiently 
degrade auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins via the expression of a 
ligand-activatable AtTIR1 protein derived from A. thaliana that adapts target 
proteins to the endogenous C. elegans proteasome. While broad expression of 
AtTIR1 using strong, ubiquitous promoters can lead to rapid degradation of 
AID-tagged proteins, cell type-specific expression of AtTIR1 using spatially 
restricted promoters often results in less efficient target protein degradation. 
To circumvent this limitation, we have developed an FLP/FRT3-based system that 
functions to reanimate a dormant, high-powered promoter that can drive 
sufficient AtTIR1 expression in a cell type-specific manner. We benchmark the 
utility of this system by generating a number of tissue-specific FLP-ON::TIR1 
drivers to reveal genetically separable cell type-specific phenotypes for 
several target proteins. We also demonstrate that the FLP-ON::TIR1 system is 
compatible with enhanced degron epitopes. Finally, we provide an expandable 
toolkit utilizing the basic FLP-ON::TIR1 system that can be adapted to drive 
optimized AtTIR1 expression in any tissue or cell type of interest.

The Tubby domain, named after the TUBBY protein in mice, binds to 
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Arabidopsis has 11 Tubby 
domain-containing proteins referred to as Tubby-Like Proteins (TLPs). Of the 11 
TLPs, 10 possess the N-terminal F-box domain, which can interact with SKP-like 
proteins and form SKP1-Cullin-F-box E3 ligase complexes. Although mice TUBBY has 
been extensively studied, plant TLPs' functions are scarcely detailed. In this 
study, we show that the Arabidopsis Tubby-like protein 6 (TLP6) and its 
redundant homologs, TLP1, TLP2, TLP5, and TLP10, positively regulate Arabidopsis 
immune responses. Furthermore, in an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry 
analysis to search for ubiquitination substrates of the TLPs, we identified two 
redundant phosphoinositide biosynthesis enzymes, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase β 
proteins (PI4Kβs), PI4Kβ1 and PI4Kβ2, as TLP interactors. Importantly, TLP6 
overexpression lines fully phenocopy the phenotypes of the pi4kβ1,2 mutant, 
while TLP6 overexpression also leads to increased PI4Kβ2 ubiquitination and 
reduction in its protein level in a proteasome-dependent manner. Most 
significantly, TLP6 overexpression does not further enhance the autoimmunity of 
the pi4kβ1,2 double mutant, supporting the hypothesis that TLP6 targets the 
PI4Kβs for ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, our study reveals a novel 
mechanism where TLPs promote plant immune responses by modulating the PI4Kβs 
protein levels.

General protein folding is mediated by chaperones that utilize ATP hydrolysis to 
regulate client binding and release. Zinc-finger protein 1 (Zpr1) is an 
essential ATP-independent chaperone dedicated to the biogenesis of eukaryotic 
translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), a highly abundant GTP-binding protein. 
How Zpr1-mediated folding is regulated to ensure rapid Zpr1 recycling remains an 
unanswered question. Here, we use yeast genetics and microscopy analysis, 
biochemical reconstitution, and structural modeling to reveal that folding of 
eEF1A by Zpr1 requires GTP hydrolysis. Furthermore, we identify the highly 
conserved altered inheritance of mitochondria 29 (Aim29) protein as a Zpr1 
co-chaperone that recognizes eEF1A in the GTP-bound, pre-hydrolysis 
conformation. This interaction dampens Zpr1⋅eEF1A GTPase activity and 
facilitates client exit from the folding cycle. Our work reveals that a bespoke 
ATP-independent chaperone system has mechanistic similarity to ATPase chaperones 
but unexpectedly relies on client GTP hydrolysis to regulate the 
chaperone-client interaction.

Eukaryotic cells are used as cell factories to produce and secrete multitudes of 
recombinant pharmaceutical proteins, including several of the current 
top-selling drugs. Due to the essential role and complexity of the secretory 
pathway, improvement for recombinant protein production through metabolic 
engineering has traditionally been relatively ad-hoc; and a more systematic 
approach is required to generate novel design principles. Here, we present the 
proteome-constrained genome-scale protein secretory model of yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae (pcSecYeast), which enables us to simulate and explain phenotypes 
caused by limited secretory capacity. We further apply the pcSecYeast model to 
predict overexpression targets for the production of several recombinant 
proteins. We experimentally validate many of the predicted targets for α-amylase 
production to demonstrate pcSecYeast application as a computational tool in 
guiding yeast engineering and improving recombinant protein production.

An Overexpression Experiment Does Not Support the Hypothesis That Avoidance of 
Toxicity Determines the Rate of Protein Evolution.

The misfolding avoidance hypothesis postulates that sequence mutations render 
proteins cytotoxic and therefore the higher the gene expression, the stronger 
the operation of selection against substitutions. This translates into 
prediction that relative toxicity of extant proteins is higher for those 
evolving faster. In the present experiment, we selected pairs of yeast genes 
which were paralogous but evolving at different rates. We expressed them 
artificially to high levels. We expected that toxicity would be higher for ones 
bearing more mutations, especially that overcrowding should rather exacerbate 
than reverse the already existing differences in misfolding rates. We did find 
that the applied mode of overexpression caused a considerable decrease in 
fitness and that the decrease was proportional to the amount of excessive 
protein. However, it was not higher for proteins which are normally expressed at 
lower levels (and have less conserved sequence). This result was obtained 
consistently, regardless whether the rate of growth or ability to compete in 
common cultures was used as a proxy for fitness. In additional experiments, we 
applied factors that reduce accuracy of translation or enhance structural 
instability of proteins. It did not change a consistent pattern of independence 
between the fitness cost caused by overexpression of a protein and the rate of 
its sequence evolution.

Trans-translation is a ubiquitous bacterial mechanism of ribosome rescue 
mediated by a transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) that adds a degradation tag to the 
truncated nascent polypeptide. Here, we characterize this quality control system 
in a genome-reduced bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MPN), and perform a 
comparative analysis of protein quality control components in slow and 
fast-growing prokaryotes. We show in vivo that in MPN the sole quality control 
cytoplasmic protease (Lon) degrades efficiently tmRNA-tagged proteins. Analysis 
of tmRNA-mutants encoding a tag resistant to proteolysis reveals extensive 
tagging activity under normal growth. Unlike knockout strains, these mutants are 
viable demonstrating the requirement of tmRNA-mediated ribosome recycling. 
Chaperone and Lon steady-state levels maintain proteostasis in these mutants 
suggesting a model in which co-evolution of Lon and their substrates offer 
simple mechanisms of regulation without specialized degradation machineries. 
Finally, comparative analysis shows relative increase in Lon/Chaperone levels in 
slow-growing bacteria suggesting physiological adaptation to growth demand.

JCVI-syn3A is a genetically minimal bacterial cell, consisting of 493 genes and 
only a single 543 kbp circular chromosome. Syn3A's genome and physical size are 
approximately one-tenth those of the model bacterial organism Escherichia 
coli's, and the corresponding reduction in complexity and scale provides a 
unique opportunity for whole-cell modeling. Previous work established 
genome-scale gene essentiality and proteomics data along with its essential 
metabolic network and a kinetic model of genetic information processing. In 
addition to that information, whole-cell, spatially-resolved kinetic models 
require cellular architecture, including spatial distributions of ribosomes and 
the circular chromosome's configuration. We reconstruct cellular architectures 
of Syn3A cells at the single-cell level directly from cryo-electron tomograms, 
including the ribosome distributions. We present a method of generating 
self-avoiding circular chromosome configurations in a lattice model with a 
resolution of 11.8 bp per monomer on a 4 nm cubic lattice. Realizations of the 
chromosome configurations are constrained by the ribosomes and geometry 
reconstructed from the tomograms and include DNA loops suggested by experimental 
chromosome conformation capture (3C) maps. Using ensembles of simulated 
chromosome configurations we predict chromosome contact maps for Syn3A cells at 
resolutions of 250 bp and greater and compare them to the experimental maps. 
Additionally, the spatial distributions of ribosomes and the DNA-crowding 
resulting from the individual chromosome configurations can be used to identify 
macromolecular structures formed from ribosomes and DNA, such as polysomes and 
expressomes.

Reconstruction of the evolution of start codons in 36 groups of closely related 
bacterial and archaeal genomes reveals purifying selection affecting AUG codons. 
The AUG starts are replaced by GUG and especially UUG significantly less 
frequently than expected under the neutral expectation derived from the 
frequencies of the respective nucleotide triplet substitutions in non-coding 
regions and in 4-fold degenerate sites. Thus, AUG is the optimal start codon 
that is actively maintained by purifying selection. However, purifying selection 
on start codons is significantly weaker than the selection on the same codons in 
coding sequences, although the switches between the codons result in 
conservative amino acid substitutions. The only exception is the AUG to UUG 
switch that is strongly selected against among start codons. Selection on start 
codons is most pronounced in evolutionarily conserved, highly expressed genes. 
Mutation of the start codon to a sub-optimal form (GUG or UUG) tends to be 
compensated by mutations in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence towards a stronger 
translation initiation signal. Together, all these findings indicate that in 
prokaryotes, translation start signals are subject to weak but significant 
selection for maximization of initiation rate and, consequently, protein 
production.

MOTIVATION: Protein solubility is an important property in industrial and 
therapeutic applications. Prediction is a challenge, despite a growing 
understanding of the relevant physicochemical properties.
RESULTS: Protein-Sol is a web server for predicting protein solubility. Using 
available data for Escherichia coli protein solubility in a cell-free expression 
system, 35 sequence-based properties are calculated. Feature weights are 
determined from separation of low and high solubility subsets. The model returns 
a predicted solubility and an indication of the features which deviate most from 
average values. Two other properties are profiled in windowed calculation along 
the sequence: fold propensity, and net segment charge. The utility of these 
additional features is demonstrated with the example of thioredoxin.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Protein-Sol webserver is available at

SCNN1B encodes the beta subunit of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC. 
Previously, we reported an association between SNP markers of SCNN1B gene and 
disease severity in cystic fibrosis-affected sibling pairs. We hypothesized that 
factors interacting with the SCNN1B genomic sequence are responsible for 
intrapair discordance. Concordant and discordant pairs differed at six SCNN1B 
markers (Praw = 0.0075, Pcorr = 0.0397 corrected for multiple testing). To 
identify the factors binding to these six SCNN1B SNPs, we performed an 
electrophoretic mobility shift assay and captured the DNA-protein complexes. 
Based on protein mass spectrometry data, the epithelial splicing regulatory 
protein ESRP2 was identified when using SCNN1B-derived probes and the 
ESRP2-SCNN1B interaction was independently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation 
assays. We observed an alternative SCNN1B transcript and demonstrated in 
16HBE14o- cells that levels of this transcript are decreased upon ESRP2 
silencing by siRNA. Furthermore, we confirmed that mildly and severely affected 
siblings have different ESPR2 genetic backgrounds and that ESRP2 markers are 
linked to the response of CF patients' nasal epithelium to amiloride, indicating 
ENaC involvement (Pbest = 0.0131, Pcorr = 0.068 for multiple testing). Our 
findings demonstrate that sibling pairs clinically discordant for CF can be used 
to identify meaningful DNA regulatory elements and interacting factors.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a crucial role in cell signaling in response to 
physiological and environmental perturbations. H2O2 can oxidize typical 2-Cys 
peroxiredoxin (PRX) first into a sulfenic acid, which resolves into a disulfide 
that can be reduced by thioredoxin (TRX)/TRX reductase (TR). At high levels, 
H2O2 can also hyperoxidize sulfenylated PRX into a sulfinic acid that can be 
reduced by sulfiredoxin (SRX). Therefore, PRX, TRX, TR, and SRX (abbreviated as 
PTRS system here) constitute the coupled sulfenylation and sulfinylation cycle 
(CSSC), where certain oxidized PRX and TRX forms also function as redox 
signaling intermediates. Earlier studies have revealed that the PTRS system is 
capable of rich signaling dynamics, including linearity, 
ultrasensitivity/switch-like response, nonmonotonicity, circadian oscillation, 
and possibly, bistability. However, the origins of ultrasensitivity, which is 
fundamentally required for redox signal amplification, have not been adequately 
characterized, and their roles in enabling complex nonlinear dynamics of the 
PTRS system remain to be determined. Through in-depth mathematical modeling 
analyses, here we revealed multiple sources of ultrasensitivity that are 
intrinsic to the CSSC, including zero-order kinetic cycles, multistep H2O2 
signaling, and a mechanism arising from diminished H2O2 removal at high PRX 
hyperoxidation state. The CSSC, structurally a positive feedback loop, is 
capable of bistability under certain parameter conditions, which requires 
embedding multiple sources of ultrasensitivity identified. Forming a negative 
feedback loop with cytosolic SRX as previously observed in energetically active 
cells, the mitochondrial PTRS system (where PRX3 is expressed) can produce 
sustained circadian oscillations through supercritical Hopf bifurcations. In 
conclusion, our study provided novel quantitative insights into the dynamical 
complexity of the PTRS system and improved appreciation of intracellular redox 
signaling.

We present CFdb, a harmonized resource of interaction proteomics data from 411 
co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) datasets spanning 21,703 fractions. 
Meta-analysis of this resource charts protein abundance, phosphorylation, and 
interactions throughout the tree of life, including a reference map of the human 
interactome. We show how large-scale CF-MS data can enhance analyses of 
individual CF-MS datasets, and exemplify this strategy by mapping the honey bee 
interactome.

Cellular organelles provide opportunities to relate biological mechanisms to 
disease. Here we use affinity proteomics, genetics and cell biology to 
interrogate cilia: poorly understood organelles, where defects cause genetic 
diseases. Two hundred and seventeen tagged human ciliary proteins create a final 
landscape of 1,319 proteins, 4,905 interactions and 52 complexes. Reverse 
tagging, repetition of purifications and statistical analyses, produce a 
high-resolution network that reveals organelle-specific interactions and 
complexes not apparent in larger studies, and links vesicle transport, the 
cytoskeleton, signalling and ubiquitination to ciliary signalling and 
proteostasis. We observe sub-complexes in exocyst and intraflagellar transport 
complexes, which we validate biochemically, and by probing structurally 
predicted, disruptive, genetic variants from ciliary disease patients. The 
landscape suggests other genetic diseases could be ciliary including 3M 
syndrome. We show that 3M genes are involved in ciliogenesis, and that patient 
fibroblasts lack cilia. Overall, this organelle-specific targeting strategy 
shows considerable promise for Systems Medicine.

Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification regulating 
protein function in almost all cellular processes. Although tens of thousands of 
phosphorylation sites have been identified in human cells, approaches to 
determine the functional importance of each phosphosite are lacking. Here, we 
manually curated 112 datasets of phospho-enriched proteins, generated from 104 
different human cell types or tissues. We re-analyzed the 6,801 proteomics 
experiments that passed our quality control criteria, creating a reference 
phosphoproteome containing 119,809 human phosphosites. To prioritize functional 
sites, we used machine learning to identify 59 features indicative of proteomic, 
structural, regulatory or evolutionary relevance and integrate them into a 
single functional score. Our approach identifies regulatory phosphosites across 
different molecular mechanisms, processes and diseases, and reveals genetic 
susceptibilities at a genomic scale. Several regulatory phosphosites were 
experimentally validated, including identifying a role in neuronal 
differentiation for phosphosites in SMARCC2, a member of the SWI/SNF 
chromatin-remodeling complex.

The RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) clamp forms one half of the DNA damage checkpoint 
system that signals the presence of substantial regions of single-stranded DNA 
arising from replication fork collapse or resection of DNA double strand breaks. 
Loaded at the 5'-recessed end of a dsDNA-ssDNA junction by the RAD17-RFC clamp 
loader complex, the phosphorylated C-terminal tail of the RAD9 subunit of 9-1-1 
engages with the mediator scaffold TOPBP1 which in turn activates the ATR 
kinase, localised through the interaction of its constitutive partner ATRIP with 
RPA-coated ssDNA. Using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) we have 
determined the structure of a complex of the human RAD17-RFC clamp loader bound 
to human 9-1-1, engaged with a dsDNA-ssDNA junction. The structure answers the 
key questions of how RAD17 confers specificity for 9-1-1 over PCNA, and how the 
clamp loader specifically recognises the recessed 5' DNA end and fixes the 
orientation of 9-1-1 on the ssDNA.

With the increased focus on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and their 
large interactomes, the question about their specificity - or more so on their 
multispecificity - arise. Here we recapitulate how specificity and 
multispecificity are quantified and address through examples if IDPs in this 
respect differ from globular proteins. The conclusion is that quantitatively, 
globular proteins and IDPs are similar when it comes to specificity. However, 
compared with globular proteins, IDPs have larger interactome sizes, a 
phenomenon that is further enabled by their flexibility, repetitive binding 
motifs and propensity to adapt to different binding partners. For IDPs, this 
adaptability, interactome size and a higher degree of multivalency opens for new 
interaction mechanisms such as facilitated exchange through trimer formation and 
ultra-sensitivity via threshold effects and ensemble redistribution. IDPs and 
their interactions, thus, do not compromise the definition of specificity. 
Instead, it is the sheer size of their interactomes that complicates its 
calculation. More importantly, it is this size that challenges how we 
conceptually envision, interpret and speak about their specificity.

The presence of many completely uncharacterized proteins, even in well-studied 
organisms such as humans, seriously hampers full understanding of the 
functioning of the living cells. ADP-ribosylation is a common post-translational 
modification of proteins; also nucleic acids and small molecules can be modified 
by the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose. This modification, important in 
cellular signalling and infection processes, is usually executed by enzymes from 
the large superfamily of ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs). Here, using 
bioinformatics approaches, we identify a novel putative ADP-ribosyltransferase 
family, conserved in eukaryotic evolution, with a divergent active site. The 
hallmark of these proteins is the ART domain nestled between flanking 
leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. LRRs are typically involved in innate immune 
surveillance. The novel family appears as putative novel 
ADP-ribosylation-related actors, most likely pseudoenzymes. Sequence divergence 
and lack of clearly detectable "classical" ART active site suggests the novel 
domains are pseudoARTs, yet atypical ART activity, or alternative enzymatic 
activity cannot be excluded. We propose that this family, including its human 
member LRRC9, may be involved in an ancient defense mechanism, with analogies to 
the innate immune system, and coupling pathogen detection to ADP-ribosyltransfer 
or other signalling mechanisms.

Recruitment of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins by an unattached 
kinetochore leads to SAC activation. This recruitment is licensed by the Mps1 
kinase, which phosphorylates the kinetochore protein Spc105 at one or more of 
its six MELT repeats. Spc105 then recruits the Bub3-Bub1 and Mad1-Mad2 
complexes, which produce the inhibitory signal that arrests cell division. The 
strength of this signal depends, in part, on the number of Bub3-Bub1 and 
Mad1-Mad2 molecules that Spc105 recruits. Therefore regulation of this 
recruitment will influence SAC signaling. To understand this regulation, we 
established the physiological binding curves that describe the binding of 
Bub3-Bub1 and Mad1-Mad2 to the budding yeast kinetochore. We find that the 
binding of both follows the mass action law. Mps1 likely phosphorylates all six 
MELT repeats of Spc105. However, two mechanisms prevent Spc105 from recruiting 
six Bub3-Bub1 molecules: low Bub1 abundance and hindrance in the binding of more 
than one Bub3-Bub1 molecule to the same Spc105. Surprisingly, the kinetochore 
recruits two Mad1-Mad2 heterotetramers for every Bub3-Bub1 molecule. Finally, at 
least three MELT repeats per Spc105 are needed for accurate chromosome 
segregation. These data reveal that kinetochore-intrinsic and -extrinsic 
mechanisms influence the physiological operation of SAC signaling, potentially 
to maximize chromosome segregation accuracy.

Every amino acid residue can influence a protein's overall stability, making 
stability highly susceptible to change throughout evolution. We consider the 
distribution of protein stabilities evolutionarily permittable under two 
previously reported protein fitness functions: flux dynamics and misfolding 
avoidance. We develop an evolutionary dynamics theory and find that it agrees 
better with an extensive protein stability data set for dihydrofolate reductase 
orthologs under the misfolding avoidance fitness function rather than the flux 
dynamics fitness function. Further investigation with ribonuclease H data 
demonstrates that not any misfolded state is avoided; rather, it is only the 
unfolded state. At the end, we discuss how our work pertains to the universal 
protein abundance-evolutionary rate correlation seen across organisms' 
proteomes. We derive a closed-form expression relating protein abundance to 
evolutionary rate that captures Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 
Homo sapiens experimental trends without fitted parameters.

Effective Population Size Predicts Local Rates but Not Local Mitigation of 
Read-through Errors.

In correctly predicting that selection efficiency is positively correlated with 
the effective population size (Ne), the nearly neutral theory provides a 
coherent understanding of between-species variation in numerous genomic 
parameters, including heritable error (germline mutation) rates. Does the same 
theory also explain variation in phenotypic error rates and in abundance of 
error mitigation mechanisms? Translational read-through provides a model to 
investigate both issues as it is common, mostly nonadaptive, and has good proxy 
for rate (TAA being the least leaky stop codon) and potential error mitigation 
via "fail-safe" 3' additional stop codons (ASCs). Prior theory of translational 
read-through has suggested that when population sizes are high, weak selection 
for local mitigation can be effective thus predicting a positive correlation 
between ASC enrichment and Ne. Contra to prediction, we find that ASC enrichment 
is not correlated with Ne. ASC enrichment, although highly phylogenetically 
patchy, is, however, more common both in unicellular species and in genes 
expressed in unicellular modes in multicellular species. By contrast, Ne does 
positively correlate with TAA enrichment. These results imply that local 
phenotypic error rates, not local mitigation rates, are consistent with a drift 
barrier/nearly neutral model.

The use of oxidizing agents is one of the most favorable approaches to kill 
bacteria in daily life. However, bacteria have been evolving to survive in the 
presence of different oxidizing agents. In this study, we aimed to obtain a 
comprehensive list of genes whose expression can make Escherichiacoli cells 
resistant to different oxidizing agents. For this purpose, we utilized the ASKA 
library and performed a genome-wide screening of ~4200 E. coli genes. Hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorite (HOCl) were tested as representative oxidizing 
agents in this study. To further validate our screening results, we used 
different E. coli strains as host cells to express or inactivate selected 
resistance genes individually. More than 100 genes obtained in this screening 
were not known to associate with oxidative stress responses before. Thus, this 
study is expected to facilitate both basic studies on oxidative stress and the 
development of antibacterial agents.

Small RNAs (sRNAs) associate with Argonaute (AGO) proteins in effector 
complexes, termed RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which regulate 
complementary transcripts by translation inhibition and/or RNA degradation. In 
the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas, several metazoans, and land plants, emerging 
evidence indicates that polyribosome-associated transcripts can be 
translationally repressed by RISCs without substantial messenger RNA (mRNA) 
destabilization. However, the mechanism of translation inhibition in a 
polyribosomal context is not understood. Here we show that Chlamydomonas VIG1, 
an ortholog of the Drosophila melanogaster Vasa intronic gene (VIG), is required 
for this process. VIG1 localizes predominantly in the cytosol and comigrates 
with monoribosomes and polyribosomes by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. 
A VIG1-deleted mutant shows hypersensitivity to the translation elongation 
inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that VIG1 may have a nonessential role in 
ribosome function/structure. Additionally, FLAG-tagged VIG1 copurifies with AGO3 
and Dicer-like 3 (DCL3), consistent with it also being a component of the RISC. 
Indeed, VIG1 is necessary for the repression of sRNA-targeted transcripts at the 
translational level but is dispensable for cleavage-mediated RNA interference 
and for the association of the AGO3 effector with polyribosomes or target 
transcripts. Our results suggest that VIG1 is an ancillary ribosomal component 
and plays a role in sRNA-mediated translation repression of polyribosomal 
transcripts.

Altered dystrophin expression was found in some tumors and recent studies 
identified a developmental onset of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Given 
that embryogenesis and carcinogenesis share many mechanisms, we analyzed a broad 
spectrum of tumors to establish whether dystrophin alteration evokes related 
outcomes. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and mutation datasets from fifty tumor 
tissues and matching controls (10,894 samples) and 140 corresponding tumor cell 
lines were analyzed. Interestingly, dystrophin transcripts and protein 
expression were found widespread across healthy tissues and at housekeeping gene 
levels. In 80% of tumors, DMD expression was reduced due to transcriptional 
downregulation and not somatic mutations. The full-length transcript encoding 
Dp427 was decreased in 68% of tumors, while Dp71 variants showed variability of 
expression. Notably, low expression of dystrophins was associated with a more 
advanced stage, older age of onset, and reduced survival across different 
tumors. Hierarchical clustering analysis of DMD transcripts distinguished 
malignant from control tissues. Transcriptomes of primary tumors and tumor cell 
lines with low DMD expression showed enrichment of specific pathways in the 
differentially expressed genes. Pathways consistently identified: ECM-receptor 
interaction, calcium signaling, and PI3K-Akt are also altered in DMD muscle. 
Therefore, the importance of this largest known gene extends beyond its roles 
identified in DMD, and certainly into oncology.

Most of the secreted and plasma membrane proteins are synthesized on 
membrane-bound ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They require 
engagement of ER-resident chaperones and foldases that assist in their folding 
and maturation. Since protein homeostasis in the ER is crucial for cellular 
function, the protein-folding status in the organelle's lumen is continually 
surveyed by a network of signaling pathways, collectively called the unfolded 
protein response (UPR). Protein-folding imbalances, or "ER stress," are detected 
by highly conserved sensors that adjust the ER's protein-folding capacity 
according to the physiological needs of the cell. We review recent developments 
in the field that have provided new insights into the ER stress-sensing 
mechanisms used by UPR sensors and the mechanisms by which they integrate 
various cellular inputs to adjust the folding capacity of the organelle to 
accommodate to fluctuations in ER protein-folding demands.

Despite the known dangers of contact allergens and their long-lasting use as 
models in immunology, their molecular mode of action largely remains unknown. In 
this study, we report that a contact allergen, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene 
(DNCB), elicits contact hypersensitivity through binding the protein we 
identify. Starting from an unbiased sampling of proteomics, we found nine 
candidate proteins with unique DNCB-modified peptide fragments. More than half 
of these fragments belonged to heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a common 
stress-response protein and a damage-associated molecular pattern, and showed 
the highest probability of incidence. Inhibition and short hairpin RNA knockdown 
of HSP90 in human monocyte cell line THP-1 suppressed the potency of DNCB by 
>80%. Next, we successfully reduced DNCB-induced contact hypersensitivity in 
HSP90-knockout mice, which confirmed our findings. Finally, we hypothesized that 
DNCB-modified HSP90 activates the immune cells through HSP90's receptor, CD91. 
Pretreatment of CD91 in THP-1 cell lines and BALB/c mice attenuated the potency 
of DNCB, consistent with the result of HSP90-knockout mice. Altogether, our data 
show that DNCB-HSP90 binding plays a role in mediating DNCB-induced contact 
hypersensitivity, and the activation of CD91 by DNCB-modified HSP90 proteins 
could mediate this process.

implications for gene regulation.

Previous work has shown that thiophosphate, a phosphate analogue, leads to a 
global shift in the distribution of cellular proteins in a variety of organisms. 
Thiophosphate, when added to culture media, gets incorporated into the nucleic 
acids of cells resulting in nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate linkages. Using 
Escherichia coli, as a model organism, it was found that the global changes in 
protein expression induced with thiophosphate could be accounted for by 
significant changes in the absolute transcription levels of more than 1500 genes 
detected via RNA seq analysis. In fact, 58% of transcripts detected in RNA seq 
studies using total RNA were increased an average of 44 × fold while the 
remaining 42% were decreased an average of 20 × fold in thiophosphate-treated 
cells. Furthermore, microarray results showed no correlation between the 
transcriptional changes observed and the known stability of the corresponding 
mRNAs measured. Overall, the total amount of non-ribosomal RNA accumulated in 
TP-treated cells was increased relative to rRNA ~ 4 × fold (1.5-6 ×). The 
results further indicated that metabolic changes may play a role in inducing the 
transcriptional profiles observed with thiophosphate. Indeed, pathway analysis 
of transcripts showed an increase in routes for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate 
(PRPP) synthesis and related derivatives, presumably due to a reduction in RNA 
turnover. These results raise the possibility that the energy savings with 
reduced RNA turnover could lead to an increased energy charge in the cell that 
induces transcriptional changes leading to an increase in biosynthetic 
processes.

Genes for highly abundant proteins in Escherichia coli avoid 5' codons that 
promote ribosomal initiation.

In many species highly expressed genes (HEGs) over-employ the synonymous codons 
that match the more abundant iso-acceptor tRNAs. Bacterial transgene codon 
randomization experiments report, however, that enrichment with such 
"translationally optimal" codons has little to no effect on the resultant 
protein level. By contrast, consistent with the view that ribosomal initiation 
is rate limiting, synonymous codon usage following the 5' ATG greatly influences 
protein levels, at least in part by modifying RNA stability. For the design of 
bacterial transgenes, for simple codon based in silico inference of protein 
levels and for understanding selection on synonymous mutations, it would be 
valuable to computationally determine initiation optimality (IO) scores for 
codons for any given species. One attractive approach is to characterize the 5' 
codon enrichment of HEGs compared with the most lowly expressed genes, just as 
translational optimality scores of codons have been similarly defined employing 
the full gene body. Here we determine the viability of this approach employing a 
unique opportunity: for Escherichia coli there is both the most extensive 
protein abundance data for native genes and a unique large-scale transgene codon 
randomization experiment enabling objective definition of the 5' codons that 
cause, rather than just correlate with, high protein abundance (that we equate 
with initiation optimality, broadly defined). Surprisingly, the 5' ends of 
native genes that specify highly abundant proteins avoid such initiation optimal 
codons. We find that this is probably owing to conflicting selection pressures 
particular to native HEGs, including selection favouring low initiation rates, 
this potentially enabling high efficiency of ribosomal usage and low noise. 
While the classical HEG enrichment approach does not work, rendering simple 
prediction of native protein abundance from 5' codon content futile, we report 
evidence that initiation optimality scores derived from the transgene experiment 
may hold relevance for in silico transgene design for a broad spectrum of 
bacteria.

Highly abundant proteins tend to evolve slowly (a trend called E-R 
anticorrelation), and a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this 
phenomenon. The misfolding avoidance hypothesis attributes the E-R 
anticorrelation to the abundance-dependent toxic effects of protein misfolding. 
To avoid these toxic effects, protein sequences (particularly those of highly 
expressed proteins) would be under selection to fold properly. One prediction of 
the misfolding avoidance hypothesis is that highly abundant proteins should 
exhibit high thermostability (i.e., a highly negative free energy of folding, 
ΔG). Thus far, only a handful of analyses have tested for a relationship between 
protein abundance and thermostability, producing contradictory results. These 
analyses have been limited by 1) the scarcity of ΔG data, 2) the fact that these 
data have been obtained by different laboratories and under different 
experimental conditions, 3) the problems associated with using proteins' melting 
energy (Tm) as a proxy for ΔG, and 4) the difficulty of controlling for 
potentially confounding variables. Here, we use computational methods to compare 
the free energy of folding of pairs of human-mouse orthologous proteins with 
different expression levels. Even though the effect size is limited, the most 
highly expressed ortholog is often the one with a more negative ΔG of folding, 
indicating that highly expressed proteins are often more thermostable.

Complex stability and dynamic subunit interchange modulates the disparate 
activities of the yeast moonlighting proteins Hal3 and Vhs3.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hal3 and Vhs3 are moonlighting proteins, acting both as 
inhibitors of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase Ppz1 and as subunits 
(together with Cab3) of the unique heterotrimeric phosphopantothenoylcysteine 
decarboxylase (PPCDC) enzyme of Hemiascomycetous yeast. Both these roles are 
essential: PPCDC catalyses the third step of coenzyme A biosynthesis, while Ppz1 
inhibition is required for regulation of monovalent cation homeostasis. However, 
the mechanisms by which these proteins' disparate activities are regulated are 
not well understood. The PPCDC domains (PDs) of Hal3, Vhs3 and Cab3 constitute 
the minimum requirement for these proteins to show both PPCDC activity and, in 
the case of Hal3 and Vhs3, to bind to Ppz1. Using these PD proteins as a model 
system to study the possibility of dynamic interchange between these roles, we 
provide evidence that Hal3 binds Ppz1 as a monomer (1:1 stoichiometry), 
requiring it to de-oligomerize from its usual homo- and heterotrimeric states 
(the latter having PPCDC activity). This de-oligomerization is made possible by 
structural features that set Hal3 apart from Vhs3, increasing its ability to 
undergo monomer exchange. These findings suggest that oligomer interchange may 
be a significant factor in the functional regulation of these proteins and their 
various unrelated (moonlighting) functions.

Populations of genetically identical microorganisms exhibit high degree of 
cell-to-cell phenotypic diversity even when grown in uniform environmental 
conditions. Heterogeneity is a genetically determined trait, which ensures 
bacterial adaptation and survival in the ever changing environmental conditions. 
Fluctuations in gene expression (noise) at the level of transcription initiation 
largely contribute to cell-to-cell variability within population. Not 
surprisingly, the analyses of the mechanisms driving phenotypic heterogeneity 
are mainly focused on the activity of promoters and transcriptional factors. 
Less attention is currently given to a role of intrinsic and factor-dependent 
transcription terminators. Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding the 
regulatory role of the multi-functional transcription termination factor Rho, 
the major inhibitor of pervasive transcription in bacteria and the emerging 
global regulator of gene expression. We propose that termination activity of Rho 
might be among the mechanisms by which cells manage the intensity of 
transcriptional noise, thus affecting population heterogeneity.

Proteogenomics has enabled the detection of novel proteins encoded in 
noncanonical or alternative open reading frames (altORFs) in genes already 
coding a reference protein. Reanalysis of proteomic and ribo-seq data revealed 
that the p53-induced death domain-containing protein (or PIDD1) gene encodes a 
second 171 amino acid protein, altPIDD1, in addition to the known 910-amino 
acid-long PIDD1 protein. The two ORFs overlap almost completely, and the 
translation initiation site of altPIDD1 is located upstream of PIDD1. AltPIDD1 
has more translational and protein level evidence than PIDD1 across various cell 
lines and tissues. In HEK293 cells, the altPIDD1 to PIDD1 ratio is 40 to 1, as 
measured with isotope-labeled (heavy) peptides and targeted proteomics. AltPIDD1 
localizes to cytoskeletal structures labeled with phalloidin and interacts with 
cytoskeletal proteins. Unlike most noncanonical proteins, altPIDD1 is not 
evolutionarily young but emerged in placental mammals. Overall, we identify 
PIDD1 as a dual-coding gene, with altPIDD1, not the annotated protein, being the 
primary product of translation.

Proteomic profiling of protease-generated N termini provides key insights into 
protease function and specificity. However, current technologies have sequence 
limitations or require specialized synthetic reagents for N-terminal peptide 
isolation. Here, we introduce an N terminomics toolbox that combines selective 
N-terminal biotinylation using 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2PCA) reagents with 
chemically cleavable linkers to enable efficient enrichment of protein N 
termini. By incorporating a commercially available alkyne-modified 2PCA in 
combination with Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), our 
strategy eliminates the need for chemical synthesis of N-terminal probes. Using 
these reagents, we developed PICS2 (Proteomic Identification of Cleavage Sites 
with 2PCA) to profile the specificity of subtilisin/kexin-type proprotein 
convertases (PCSKs). We also implemented CHOPPER (chemical enrichment of 
protease substrates with purchasable, elutable reagents) for global sequencing 
of apoptotic proteolytic cleavage sites. Based on their broad applicability and 
ease of implementation, PICS2 and CHOPPER are useful tools that will advance our 
understanding of protease biology.

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to understanding biological 
systems as protein complexes are the active molecular modules critical for 
carrying out cellular functions. Dysfunctional PPIs have been associated with 
various diseases including cancer. Systems-wide PPI analysis not only sheds 
light on pathological mechanisms, but also represents a paradigm in identifying 
potential therapeutic targets. In recent years, cross-linking mass spectrometry 
(XL-MS) has emerged as a powerful tool for defining endogenous PPIs of cellular 
networks. While proteome-wide studies have been performed in cell lysates, 
intact cells and tissues, applications of XL-MS in clinical samples have not 
been reported. In this study, we adopted a DSBSO-based in vivo XL-MS platform to 
map interaction landscapes from two breast cancer patient-derived xenograft 
(PDX) models. As a result, we have generated a PDX interaction network 
comprising 2,557 human proteins and identified interactions unique to breast 
cancer subtypes. Interestingly, most of the observed differences in PPIs 
correlated well with protein abundance changes determined by TMT-based proteome 
quantitation. Collectively, this work has demonstrated the feasibility of XL-MS 
analysis in clinical samples, and established an analytical workflow for tissue 
cross-linking that can be generalized for mapping PPIs from patient samples in 
the future to dissect disease-relevant cellular networks.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been instrumental in the identification 
of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of aging. C. elegans also has recently 
been found to have evolutionarily conserved extracellular vesicle (EV) signaling 
pathways. We have been developing tools that allow for the detailed study of EV 
biology in C. elegans. Here we apply our recently published method for high 
specificity purification of EVs from C. elegans to carry out target-independent 
proteomic and RNA analysis of nematode EVs. We identify diverse coding and 
non-coding RNA and protein cargo types commonly found in human EVs. The EV cargo 
spectrum is distinct from whole worms, suggesting that protein and RNA cargos 
are actively recruited to EVs. Gene ontology analysis revealed C. elegans EVs 
are enriched for extracellular-associated and signaling proteins, and network 
analysis indicates enrichment for metabolic, immune, and basement membrane 
associated proteins. Tissue enrichment and gene expression analysis suggests the 
secreted EV proteins are likely to be derived from intestine, muscle, and 
excretory tissue. An unbiased comparison of the EV proteins with a large 
database of C. elegans genome-wide microarray data showed significant overlap 
with gene sets that are associated with aging and immunity. Taken together our 
data suggest C. elegans could be a promising in vivo model for studying the 
genetics and physiology of EVs in a variety of contexts including aging, 
metabolism, and immune response.
