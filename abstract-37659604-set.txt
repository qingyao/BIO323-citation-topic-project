The "Protein Abundances Across Organisms" database (PaxDb) is an integrative 
metaresource dedicated to protein abundance levels, in tissue-specific or 
whole-organism proteomes. PaxDb focuses on computing best-estimate abundances 
for proteins in normal/healthy contexts and expresses abundance values for each 
protein in "parts per million" in relation to all other protein molecules in the 
cell. The uniform data reprocessing, quality scoring, and integrated orthology 
relations have made PaxDb one of the preferred tools for comparisons between 
individual datasets, tissues, or organisms. In describing the latest version 5.0 
of PaxDb, we particularly emphasize the data integration from various types of 
raw data and how we expanded the number of organisms and tissue groups as well 
as the proteome coverage. The current collection of PaxDb includes 831 original 
datasets from 170 species, including 22 Archaea, 81 Bacteria, and 67 Eukaryota. 
Apart from detailing the data update, we also present a comparative analysis of 
the human proteome subset of PaxDb against the two most widely used human 
proteome data resources: Human Protein Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression. 
Lastly, through our protein abundance data, we reveal an evolutionary trend in 
the usage of sulfur-containing amino acids in the proteomes of Fungi.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has revolutionized bacterial identification 
and elucidated many molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial growth, community 
formation, and drug resistance. However, most research has been focused on a few 
model bacteria, overlooking bacterial diversity. In this study, we present the 
most extensive bacterial proteomic resource to date, covering 303 species, 119 
genera, and five phyla with over 636,000 unique expressed proteins, confirming 
the existence of over 38,700 hypothetical proteins. Accessible via the public 
resource ProteomicsDB, this dataset enables quantitative exploration of proteins 
within and across species. Additionally, we developed MS2Bac, a bacterial 
identification algorithm that queries NCBI's bacterial proteome space in two 
iterations. MS2Bac achieved over 99% species-level and 89% strain-level 
accuracy, surpassing methods like MALDI-TOF and FTIR, as demonstrated with 
food-derived bacterial isolates. MS2Bac also effectively identified bacteria in 
clinical samples, highlighting the potential of MS-based proteomics as a routine 
diagnostic tool.

Pathological cardiac remodeling is associated with the reactivation of fetal 
genes, yet the extent of the heart's fetal gene program and its impact on 
proteome compositions remain incompletely understood. Here, using a new 
proteome-wide protein ratio quantification strategy with mass spectrometry, we 
identify pervasive isoform usage shifts in fetal and postnatal mouse hearts, 
involving 145 pairs of highly homologous paralogs and alternative 
splicing-derived isoform proteins. Proteome-wide ratio comparisons readily 
rediscover hallmark fetal gene signatures in muscle contraction and glucose 
metabolism pathways, while revealing novel isoform usage in mitochondrial and 
gene expression proteins, including PPA1/PPA2, ANT1/ANT2, and PCBP1/PCBP2 
switches. Paralogs with differential fetal usage tend to be evolutionarily 
recent, consistent with functional diversification. Alternative splicing adds 
another rich source of fetal isoform usage differences, involving PKM M1/M2, 
GLS-1 KGA/GAC, PDLIM5 long/short, and other spliceoforms. When comparing 
absolute protein proportions, we observe a partial reversion toward fetal gene 
usage in pathological hearts. In summary, we present a ratiometric catalog of 
paralogs and spliceoform pairs in the cardiac fetal gene program. More 
generally, the results demonstrate the potential of applying the proteome-wide 
ratio test concept to discover new regulatory modalities beyond differential 
gene expression.

The evolving landscape of chemical risk assessment is increasingly focused on 
developing tiered, mechanistically driven approaches that avoid the use of 
animal experiments. In this context, adverse outcome pathways have gained 
importance for evaluating various types of chemical-induced toxicity. Using 
hepatic steatosis as a case study, this review explores the use of diverse 
computational techniques, such as structure-activity relationship models, 
quantitative structure-activity relationship models, read-across methods, omics 
data analysis, and structure-based approaches to fill data gaps within adverse 
outcome pathway networks. Emphasizing the regulatory acceptance of each 
technique, we examine how these methodologies can be integrated to provide a 
comprehensive understanding of chemical toxicity. This review highlights the 
transformative impact of in silico techniques in toxicology, proposing 
guidelines for their application in evidence gathering for developing and 
filling data gaps in adverse outcome pathway networks. These guidelines can be 
applied to other cases, advancing the field of toxicological risk assessment.

The immunization of mice with the sterile culture medium supernatants of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv permitted the production of several 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for secreted and/or released antigens. Two 
mAbs bound and immunoprecipitated an 80-kDa protein that was identified by mass 
spectrometry as Rv1133c, the methionine synthase MetE. The protein MetE is 
ubiquitous among prokaryota and shows a significant sequence homology in many 
bacteria. We produced both the full-length recombinant MetE and its N-terminal 
fragment, whose sequence is more conserved among mycobacteria, to select mAbs 
recognizing an Mtb-specific region of MetE. Finally, we produced and selected 
eight mAbs that specifically detect the MetE protein in the supernatant and cell 
lysate of Mtb and BCG, but not other bacteria such as non-tuberculous 
mycobacteria (NTM), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, 
Acinetobacter baumanii, or Escherichia coli. Taking advantage of our mAbs, we 
studied (i) the vitamin B12 dependence for the synthesis of MetE in Mtb and NTM 
and (ii) the kinetics of MetE production and secretion in supernatants during 
the in vitro reproduced replicative, dormant, and resuscitation cycle of Mtb. 
Our data demonstrate that dormant Mtb, which are assumed to be prevalent in 
latent infections, as well as NTM do not produce and secrete MetE. Results 
indicate an unexpected specificity for Mtb of our anti-MetE mAbs and encourage 
the use of rMetE and our mAbs as tools for the immunodiagnosis of TB and its 
stages.

Microbial production of aromatic compounds from renewable feedstocks has gained 
increasing interest as a means towards sustainable production of chemicals. The 
potential of filamentous fungi for production of aromatic compounds has 
nonetheless not yet been widely exploited. Notably, many filamentous fungi can 
naturally break down lignin and metabolize lignin-derived aromatic compounds. A 
few examples where a fungal cell factory, often of Aspergillus spp., is used to 
produce an aromatic compound, typically through the conversion of one compound 
to another, have already been reported. In this review, we summarize fungal 
biosynthesis of biotechnologically interesting aromatic compounds. The focus is 
on compounds produced from the shikimate pathway. Biorefinery-relevant efforts 
for valorizing residual biomass or lignin derived compounds are also discussed. 
The advancement in engineering tools combined with the increasing amounts of 
data supporting the discovery of new enzymes and development of new bioprocesses 
has led to an increased range of potential production hosts and products. This 
is expected to translate into a wider utilization of fungal cell factories for 
production of aromatic compounds.

The cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) targeting complex is 
responsible for maturation of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur enzymes, 
numbering >30 proteins critical for fundamental processes such as DNA 
replication and repair. Up to 25% of these client proteins terminate in a 
targeting complex recognition (TCR) motif. This carboxy-terminal tripeptide 
motif recruits the CIA targeting complex (CTC) to the client so that the 
metallocluster can be inserted. Herein, we use a combination of computational, 
biochemical and biophysical approaches to determine that the clients bearing a 
TCR motif docks at the interface of the Cia1 and Cia2 subunits of the CTC. Thus, 
mutations destabilizing the Cia1-Cia2 complex also disrupt TCR-based client 
identification by the CTC. Our study also reveals that the understudied human 
Cia2 paralog CIAO2A, which is proposed to be a specific targeting factor for 
iron regulatory protein 1, can recruit clients terminating in the TCR peptide. 
These data signal that CIAO2A plays a more general role in iron-sulfur protein 
maturation than previously appreciated. Taken together, our findings deepen our 
understanding of the molecular basis for client recognition by the CTC that is 
critical to understand the impact of CIA function in human health and disease.

The development and implementation of microbial chassis cells have profound 
impacts on circular economy. Non-model bacterium Zymomonas mobilis is an 
excellent chassis owing to its extraordinary industrial characteristics. Here, 
the genome-scale metabolic model iZM516 is improved and updated by integrating 
enzyme constraints to simulate the dynamics of flux distribution and guide 
pathway design. We show that the innate dominant ethanol pathway of Z. mobilis 
restricts the titer and rate of these biochemicals. A dominant-metabolism 
compromised intermediate-chassis (DMCI) strategy is then developed through 
introducing low toxicity but cofactor imbalanced 2,3-butanediol pathway, and a 
recombinant D-lactate producer is constructed to produce more than 140.92 g/L 
and 104.6 g/L D-lactate (yield > 0.97 g/g) from glucose and corncob residue 
hydrolysate, respectively. Additionally, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life 
cycle assessment (LCA) demonstrate the commercialization feasibility and 
greenhouse gas reduction capability of lignocellulosic D-lactate. This work thus 
establishes a paradigm for engineering recalcitrant microorganisms as 
biorefinery chassis.

Cells carefully regulate cytosolic iron, which is a vital enzymatic cofactor, 
yet is toxic in excess. In mammalian cells, surplus iron is sequestered in 
ferritin cages that, in iron limiting conditions, are degraded through the 
selective autophagy pathway ferritinophagy to liberate free iron. Prior work 
identified the ferritinophagy receptor protein NCOA4, which links ferritin and 
LC3/GABARAP-family member GATE16, effectively tethering ferritin to the 
autophagic machinery. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this 
interaction, discovering two short linear motifs in NCOA4 that each bind GATE16 
with weak affinity. These binding motifs are highly avid and, in concert, 
support high-affinity NCOA4•GATE16 complex formation. We further find the 
minimal NCOA4383-522 fragment bearing these motifs is sufficient for 
ferritinophagy and that both motifs are necessary for this activity. This work 
suggests a general mechanism wherein selective autophagy receptors can 
distinguish between the inactive soluble pools of LC3/GABARAPs and the active 
membrane-conjugated forms that drive autophagy. Finally, we find that iron 
decreases NCOA4383-522's affinity for GATE16, providing a plausible mechanism 
for iron-dependent regulation of ferritinophagy.

Natural selection is believed to shape amino acid usage of the proteome by 
minimizing the energy cost of protein biosynthesis. Although this hypothesis 
explains well the amino acid frequency (AAfrequency) difference among the 20 
common amino acids within a given genome (species), whether it is applicable to 
cross-species difference remains to be inspected. Here, we proposed and tested a 
"metabolic rate hypothesis," which suggests that metabolic rate impacts 
genome-wide AAfrequency, considering that the energy allocated to protein 
biosynthesis is under selection pressure due to metabolic rate constraint. We 
performed integrated phylogenetic comparative analyses on proteomic sequence and 
metabolic rate data of 166 species covering 130 eumetazoan orders. We showed 
that resting metabolic rate (RMR) was significantly linked to AAfrequency 
variation across animal lineages, with a contribution comparable to or greater 
than genomic traits such as GC content and codon usage bias. Consistent with the 
metabolic rate hypothesis, low-energy-cost amino acids are observed to be more 
likely at higher frequency in animal species with high (residual) metabolic 
rate. Correlated evolution of RMR and AAfrequency was further inferred being 
driven by adaptation. The relationship between RMR and AAfrequency varied 
greatly among amino acids, most likely reflecting a trade-off among various 
interacting factors. Overall, there exists no "one-size-fits-all" predictor for 
AAfrequency, and integrated investigation of multilevel traits is indispensable 
for a fuller understanding of AAfrequency variation and evolution in animal.

Oligonucleotide therapeutics hold promise for targeted gene silencing, yet 
achieving optimal tissue-specific delivery remains challenging. This study 
introduces a mechanistic whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
model to predict tissue uptake dynamics of both conjugated (targeted) and 
unconjugated oligonucleotides across species. The model incorporates two uptake 
pathways: a non-saturable nonspecific pathway for all oligonucleotides and 
receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) specific to conjugated molecules. Parameters 
for nonspecific uptake were derived from plasma and tissue concentration data of 
unconjugated antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in rats, while RME parameters for 
N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated oligonucleotides targeting the 
asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) were obtained from literature. Model 
validation against experimental data for conjugated and unconjugated ASOs and 
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in rats and mice demonstrated good predictive 
performance, with median predicted-to-observed AUC ratios of 0.84 (Interquartile 
range [IQR] 0.434-1.22) in rats and 0.629 (IQR 0.3-1.6) in mice. Local 
sensitivity analyses identified key parameters and processes influencing organ 
uptake, including the unbound plasma fraction and receptor-mediated uptake 
efficiency. Simulations highlighted the potential of sustained-release 
formulations to improve targeting specificity by mitigating receptor saturation. 
This is the first whole-body PBPK model to describe oligonucleotide 
pharmacokinetics across species and modalities. The model provides critical 
mechanistic insights to optimize tissue-specific delivery, guide formulation 
strategies, and enhance therapeutic outcomes for targeted oligonucleotide 
therapeutics.

The regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundances is well-studied, 
but less is known about the evolutionary processes shaping their relationship. 
To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to 
multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing 
selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations 
affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA 
abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) 
mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational 
opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters 
with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and 
selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework 
for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression.

Cells remodel their proteomes in response to changing environments by 
coordinating changes in protein synthesis and degradation. In yeast, such 
degradation involves both proteasomal and vacuolar activity, with a mixture of 
bulk and selective autophagy delivering many of the vacuolar substrates. 
Although these pathways are known to be generally important for such remodeling, 
their relative contributions have not been reported on a proteome-wide basis. To 
assess this, we developed a method to pulse-label the methylotrophic yeast 
Komagataella phaffii (i.e. Pichia pastoris) with isotopically labeled nutrients, 
which, when coupled to quantitative proteomics, allowed us to globally monitor 
protein degradation on a protein-by-protein basis following an environmental 
perturbation. Using genetic ablations, we found that a targeted combination of 
bulk and selective autophagy drove the vast majority of the observed proteome 
remodeling activity, with minimal non-autophagic contributions. Cytosolic 
proteins and protein complexes, including ribosomes, were degraded via 
Atg11-independent bulk autophagy, whereas proteins targeted to the peroxisome 
and mitochondria were primarily degraded in an Atg11-dependent manner. Notably, 
these degradative pathways were independently regulated by environmental cues. 
Taken together, our new approach greatly increases the range of known autophagic 
substrates and highlights the outsized impact of autophagy on proteome 
remodeling. Moreover, the resulting datasets, which we have packaged in an 
accessible online database, constitute a rich resource for identifying proteins 
and pathways involved in fungal proteome remodeling.

Understanding what drives protein abundance is essential to biology, medicine, 
and biotechnology. Driven by evolutionary selection, an amino acid sequence is 
tailored to meet the required abundance of a proteome, underscoring the 
intricate relationship between sequence and functional demand. Yet, the specific 
role of amino acid sequences in determining proteome abundance remains elusive. 
Here we show that the amino acid sequence alone encodes over half of protein 
abundance variation across all domains of life, ranging from bacteria to mouse 
and human. With an attempt to go beyond predictions, we trained a 
manageable-size Transformer model to interpret latent factors predictive of 
protein abundances. Intuitively, the model's attention focused on the protein's 
structural features linked to stability and metabolic costs related to protein 
synthesis. To probe these relationships, we introduce MGEM (Mutation Guided by 
an Embedded Manifold), a methodology for guiding protein abundance through 
sequence modifications. We find that mutations which increase predicted 
abundance have significantly altered protein polarity and hydrophobicity, 
underscoring a connection between protein structural features and abundance. 
Through molecular dynamics simulations we revealed that abundance-enhancing 
mutations possibly contribute to protein thermostability by increasing rigidity, 
which occurs at a lower synthesis cost.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), malignant cells surviving chemotherapy rely on 
high mRNA translation and their microenvironmental metabolic support to drive 
relapse. However, the role of translational reprogramming in the niche is 
unclear. Here, we found that relapsing AML cells increase translation in their 
bone marrow (BM) niches, where BM mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) become a 
source of eIF4A-cap-dependent translation machinery that is transferred to AML 
cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs) to meet their translational demands. In 
two independent models of highly chemo-resistant AML driven by MLL-AF9 or 
FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) and nucleophosmin (NPMc) mutations, 
protein synthesis levels increase in refractory AML dependent on nestin+ BMSCs. 
Inhibiting cap-dependent translation in BMSCs abolishes their chemoprotective 
ability, while EVs from BMSCs carrying eIF4A boost AML cell translation and 
survival. Consequently, eIF4A inhibition synergizes with conventional 
chemotherapy. Together, these results suggest that AML cells rely on BMSCs to 
maintain an oncogenic translational program required for relapse.

The main forces driving protein complex evolution are currently not well 
understood, especially in homomers, where quaternary structure might frequently 
evolve neutrally. Here we examine the factors determining oligomerisation by 
analysing the evolution of enzymes in circumstances where homomers rarely 
evolve. We show that 1) In extracellular environments, most enzymes with known 
structure are monomers, while in the cytoplasm homomers, indicating that the 
evolution of oligomers is cellular environment dependent; 2) The evolution of 
quaternary structure within protein orthogroups is more consistent with the 
predictions of constructive neutral evolution than an adaptive process: 
quaternary structure is gained easier than it is lost, and most extracellular 
monomers evolved from proteins that were monomers also in their ancestral state, 
without the loss of interfaces. Our results indicate that oligomerisation is 
context-dependent, and even when adaptive, in many cases it is probably not 
driven by the intrinsic properties of enzymes, like their biochemical function, 
but rather the properties of the environment where the enzyme is active. These 
factors might be macromolecular crowding and excluded volume effects 
facilitating the evolution of interfaces, and the maintenance of cellular 
homeostasis through shaping cytoplasm fluidity, protein degradation, or 
diffusion rates.

In bacteria, high A and low G content of the 5' end of the coding sequence (CDS) 
promotes low RNA stability, facilitating ribosomal initiation and subsequently a 
high protein to transcript ratio. Additionally, 5' NGG codons are suppressive 
owing to peptidyl-tRNA drop off. It was, therefore, surprising that the first 
large-scale transgene experiment to interrogate the 5' effect by codon 
randomization found the NGG, G-rich codon AGG to be the most associated with 
high transgene output. Why is this? We show that this is not replicated in other 
large transgene datasets, where AGG and NGG are associated with low efficiency. 
More generally, there is limited agreement between the first experiment and 
others. This we find to be a consequence of non-random construct design. In 
constructs of the first experiment, AGG disproportionately occurs with non-AGG 
codons associated with low stability and high protein output, making AGG's 
association with high output an artefact. While translationally non-optimal 
codons like AGG are conjectured to slow ribosomes for orderly initiation, we 
find that in the less biased constructs high, not low, translational adaptation 
in the first 10 codons is (weakly) predictive of higher translational 
efficiency. These results have implications for both transgene and experimental 
design.

An important role of a particular synonymous codon composition of a gene in its 
expression level is well known. There are a number of algorithms optimizing 
codon usage of recombinant genes to maximize their expression in host cells. 
Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism remains unsolved and is of significant 
relevance. In the realm of modern biotechnology, directing protein production to 
a specific level is crucial for metabolic engineering, genome rewriting and a 
growing number of other applications. In this study, we propose two new simple 
statistical and empirical methods for predicting the protein expression level 
from the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene: Codon Expression Index 
Score (CEIS) and Codon Productivity Score (CPS). Both of these methods are based 
on the influence of each individual codon in the gene on the overall expression 
level of the encoded protein and the frequencies of isoacceptors in the species. 
Our predictions achieve a correlation level of up to r = 0.7 with experimentally 
measured quantitative proteome data of Escherichia coli, which is superior to 
any previously proposed methods. Our work helps understand how codons determine 
protein abundances. Based on these methods, it is possible to design proteins 
optimized for expression in a particular organism.

High soluble protein expression in heterologous hosts is crucial for various 
research and applications. Despite considerable research on the impact of codon 
usage on expression levels, the relationship between protein sequence and 
expression is often overlooked. In this study, a novel connection between 
protein expression and sequence is uncovered, leading to the development of SRAB 
(Strength of Relative Amino Acid Bias) based on AEI (Amino Acid Expression 
Index). The AEI served as an objective measure of this correlation, with higher 
AEI values enhancing soluble expression. Subsequently, the pre-trained protein 
model MP-TRANS (MindSpore Protein Transformer) is developed and fine-tuned using 
transfer learning techniques to create 88 prediction models (MPB-EXP) for 
predicting heterologous expression levels across 88 species. This approach 
achieved an average accuracy of 0.78, surpassing conventional machine learning 
methods. Additionally, a mutant generation model, MPB-MUT, is devised and 
utilized to enhance expression levels in specific hosts. Experimental validation 
demonstrated that the top 3 mutants of xylanase (previously not expressed in 
Escherichia coli) successfully achieved high-level soluble expression in E. 
coli. These findings highlight the efficacy of the developed model in predicting 
and optimizing gene expression based on protein sequences.

The transcription factor TOX has attracted attention in recent years for its 
role in CD8+ T cell exhaustion. In fact, TOX was known historically for its 
diverse roles in immune cell biology. Here, we inquire into the basis for this 
versatility, and propose that one main consideration is that TOX is an HMG-box 
transcription factor. We discuss some mechanisms that other HMG-box 
transcription factors employ to perform their cellular functions, as examples of 
the range of mechanisms TOX might employ in furthering T cell exhaustion. This 
inquiry begins with the literature placing TOX as a central player in CD8+ T 
cell exhaustion and in other immune cell processes. An understanding of TOX as a 
transcription factor has to be organized around its binding to relevant target 
sites in DNA. Thus, we next cover the reasons that TOX is classified as an 
HMG-box protein, the well-defined but narrow scope of what TOX shares with other 
HMG-box proteins, and the unequivocal evidence that binding of HMG-box proteins 
stabilizes kinked or bent DNA. We consider the constant features and some 
variables in DNA recognition by HMG-box proteins. Since binding and bending DNA 
is not in isolation an explanation of any biological process, we look at 
biological examples highlighting specific ways that HMG-box proteins drive 
cellular processes. Finally, we outline some lines of research that could be 
informative in understanding the cellular mechanisms of TOX in T cell 
exhaustion.

Cholestasis is characterized by disrupted bile flow from the liver to the small 
intestine. Although etiologically different cholestasis displays similar 
symptoms, diverse factors can contribute to the progression of the disease and 
determine the appropriate therapeutic option. Therefore, stratifying cholestatic 
patients is essential for the development of tailor-made treatment strategies. 
Here, we have analyzed the liver proteome from cholestatic patients of different 
etiology. In total, 7161 proteins were identified and quantified, of which 263 
were differentially expressed between control and cholestasis groups. These 
differential proteins point to deregulated cellular processes that explain part 
of the molecular framework of cholestasis progression. However, the clustering 
of different cholestasis types was limited. Therefore, a machine learning 
pipeline was designed to identify a panel of 20 differential proteins that 
segregate different cholestasis groups with high accuracy and sensitivity. In 
summary, proteomics combined with machine learning algorithms provides valuable 
insights into the molecular mechanisms of cholestasis progression and a panel of 
proteins to discriminate across different types of cholestasis. This strategy 
may prove useful in developing precision medicine approaches for patient care.

Much of the study of protein sequence evolution is based on sequence changes 
inferred to have occurred in nature. The sequences compared for this purpose are 
usually sufficiently distant that purifying selection has had nearly its full 
effect and most of the changes inferred have been exposed to a variety of 
conditions. Here, I make use of large numbers of Salmonella genome sequences to 
study changes known to be of very recent origin because they are inferred from 
comparison of very closely related sequences. The effects of purifying selection 
are weak yet discernible on this short timescale: the ratio of nonsynonymous to 
synonymous changes is smaller than expected under selective neutrality, but only 
slightly so. Essential genes have lower rates of nonsynonymous change, as they 
do on a longer timescale, but much more of this association remains after 
controlling for expression level. Positive selection for nonsynonymous change is 
inferred for 151 genes. For nearly half of these, this is attributable to 
selection for loss of function. Other forms of positive selection inferred 
include selection for amino acid changes that make enzymes less sensitive to 
antibiotics and selection for activating changes to proteins involved in 
transcriptional regulation. Positively selected variants of many genes are 
likely favored only under unusual conditions and disfavored in the long term, 
making detection of the positive selection with more distant comparisons 
difficult or impossible. The short-term view provided by close comparisons 
complements the long-term view obtained from more distant comparisons such as 
those between species.

The main function of translation initiation factors is to assist ribosomes in 
selecting the correct reading frame on an mRNA. This process has been 
extensively studied with the help of reconstituted in vitro systems, but the 
dynamics in living cells have not been characterized. In this study, we 
performed single-molecule tracking of the bacterial initiation factors IF2, IF3, 
as well as the initiator fMet-tRNAfMet directly in growing Escherichia coli 
cells. Our results reveal the kinetics of factor association with the ribosome 
and, among other things, highlight the respective antagonistic roles of IF2 and 
IF3 in the process. Importantly, our comparisons of in vivo binding kinetics of 
two naturally occurring isoforms of IF2 reveal that the longer IF2α isoform 
directly interacts with the transcriptional factor NusA, a finding further 
corroborated by pull-down and cross-linking experiments. Our results suggest 
that this interaction may promote formation of a coupled 
transcription-translation complex early in the translation cycle, motivating 
further structural studies to validate the mechanism. We further show that cells 
with compromised binding between IF2α and NusA display slow adaptation to new 
growth conditions.

Biomolecular condensates are membraneless assemblies of proteins and nucleic 
acids, often formed through liquid-liquid phase separation. They selectively 
concentrate specific biomolecules and play essential roles in diverse cellular 
processes and diseases. This review discusses the emerging roles of biomolecular 
condensates in pre-mRNA 3' end processing, a critical step in mRNA biogenesis. 
3' end processing factors are enriched in intrinsically disordered regions and 
undergo phase separation to form condensates that, in turn, fine-tune the 
efficiency and specificity of 3' end processing. Additionally, we describe how 
distinct 3' end processing pathways are spatially and functionally 
compartmentalized within nuclear biomolecular condensates, such as nuclear 
speckles and histone locus bodies. Finally, we propose that 3' end processing 
represents a promising experimental system to investigate fundamental principles 
underlying biomolecular condensate formation and function. This article is

The minichromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) protein complexes are central drivers of 
genome duplication. Distinct protein pools, parental and nascent MCMs, and their 
precise equilibrium are essential to sustain error-free DNA replication. 
However, the mechanism responsible for generating these pools and maintaining 
their equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here, we identified CRL4DCAF12 as 
a factor controlling the assembly of nascent MCM complexes. During MCM 
biogenesis, MCMBP facilitates the assembly and transport of newly synthesized 
MCM3-7 subcomplexes into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the MCM2 subunit must 
be incorporated into the MCM3-7 subcomplex, while MCMBP needs to be removed. 
CRL4DCAF12 facilitates the degradation of MCMBP and thereby regulates the 
assembly of MCM2-7 complexes. The absence of CRL4DCAF12 adversely affects the 
level of chromatin-bound nascent MCMs, resulting in accelerated replication 
forks and replication stress. Collectively, our findings uncovered the molecular 
mechanism underlying nascent MCM production essential to counteract genome 
instability.

BACKGROUND: Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a serine/threonine 
kinase, which regulates programmed cell death and inflammation. Recently, the 
involvement of RIPK1 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been 
reported; RIPK1 is involved in microglia's phenotypic transition to their 
dysfunctional states, and it is highly expressed in the neurons and microglia in 
the postmortem brains in AD patients. They prompt neurodegeneration leading to 
accumulations of pathological proteins in AD. Therefore, regulation of RIPK1 
could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD, and in vivo 
imaging of RIPK1 may become a useful modality in studies of drug discovery and 
pathophysiology of AD. The purpose of this study was to develop a suitable 
radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of RIPK1.
RESULTS: (S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one 
(GSK'963) has a high affinity, selectivity for RIPK1, and favorable 
physiochemical properties based on its chemical structure. In this study, since 
11C-labeling (half-life: 20.4 min) GSK'963 retaining its structure requiring the 
Grignard reaction of tert-butylmagnesium halides and [11C]carbon dioxide was 
anticipated to give a low yield, we decided instead to 11C-label a GSK'963 
analog 
((S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-(m-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one, 
GG502), which has a high RIPK1 inhibitory activity equivalent to that of the 
original compound GSK'963. Thus, we successfully 11C-labeled GG502 using a 
Pd-mediated cross-coupling reaction in favorable yields (3.6 ± 1.9%) and 
radiochemical purities (> 96%), and molar activity (47-115 GBq/μmol). On 
autoradiography, radioactivity accumulation was observed for [11C]GG502 and 
decreased by non-radioactive GG502 in the mouse spleen and human brain, 
indicating the possibility of specific binding of this ligand to RIPK1. On brain 
PET imaging in a rhesus monkey, [11C]GG502 showed a good brain permeability 
(peak standardized uptake value (SUV) ~3.0), although there was no clear 
evidence of specific binding of [11C]GG502. On brain PET imaging in acute 
inflammation model rats, [11C]GG502 also showed a good brain permeability, and 
no significant increased uptake was observed in the lipopolysaccharide-treated 
side of striatum. On metabolite analysis in rats at 30 min after administration 
of [11C]GG502, ~55% and ~10% of radioactivity was from unmetabolized [11C]GG502 
in the brain and the plasma, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We synthesized and evaluated a 11C-labeled PET ligand based on the 
methylated analog of GSK'963 for imaging of RIPK1 in the brain. Although in 
autoradiography of the resulting [11C]GG502 indicated the possibility of 
specific binding, the actual PET imaging failed to detect any evidence of 
specific binding to RIPK1 despite its good brain permeability. Further 
development of radioligands with a higher binding affinity for RIPK1 in vivo and 
more stable metabolite profiles compared with the current compound may be 
required.

Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has the potential to map the interactome 
of the cell with high resolution and depth of coverage. However, current in vivo 
XL-MS methods are hampered by crosslinkers that demonstrate low cell 
permeability and require long reaction times. Consequently, interactome sampling 
is not high and long incubation times can distort the cell, bringing into 
question the validity any protein interactions identified by the method. We 
address these issues with a fast formaldehyde-based fixation method applied 
prior to the introduction of secondary crosslinkers. Using human A549 cells and 
a range of reagents, we show that 4% formaldehyde fixation with membrane 
permeabilization preserves cellular ultrastructure and simultaneously improves 
reaction conditions for in situ XL-MS. Protein labeling yields can be increased 
even for nominally membrane-permeable reagents, and surprisingly, 
high-concentration formaldehyde does not compete with conventional 
amine-reactive crosslinking reagents. Prefixation with permeabilization 
uncouples cellular dynamics from crosslinker dynamics, enhancing control over 
crosslinking yield and permitting the use of any chemical crosslinker.

The availability of an increasingly large amount of public proteomics data sets 
presents an opportunity for performing combined analyses to generate 
comprehensive organism-wide protein expression maps across different organisms 
and biological conditions. Sus scrofa, a domestic pig, is a model organism 
relevant for food production and for human biomedical research. Here, we 
reanalyzed 14 public proteomics data sets from the PRIDE database coming from 
pig tissues to assess baseline (without any biological perturbation) protein 
abundance in 14 organs, encompassing a total of 20 healthy tissues from 128 
samples. The analysis involved the quantification of protein abundance in 599 
mass spectrometry runs. We compared protein expression patterns among different 
pig organs and examined the distribution of proteins across these organs. Then, 
we studied how protein abundances were compared across different data sets and 
studied the tissue specificity of the detected proteins. Of particular interest, 
we conducted a comparative analysis of protein expression between pig and human 
tissues, revealing a high degree of correlation in protein expression among 
orthologs, particularly in brain, kidney, heart, and liver samples. We have 
integrated the protein expression results into the Expression Atlas resource for 
easy access and visualization of the protein expression data individually or 
alongside gene expression data.

The membranes surrounding the eukaryotic cell and its organelles are 
continuously invaginating, budding, and undergoing membrane fusion-fission 
events, which enable them to perform functions not found in prokaryotic cells. 
In addition, organelles come into close contact with each other at membrane 
contact sites (MCSs), which involve many types of proteins, and which regulate 
the signaling and transport of various molecules. Vesicle-associated membrane 
protein (VAMP)-associated protein (VAP) is an important factor involved in the 
tethering and contact of various organelles at MCSs in almost all eukaryotes and 
has attracted attention for its association with various diseases, mainly 
neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, 
the detailed mechanism of its functional expression remains unclear. In this 
review, we quantitatively discuss the structural dynamics of the entire 
molecule, including intrinsically disordered regions and intramolecular and 
intermolecular interactions, focusing on the vertebrate VAP paralogs VAPA and 
VAPB. Molecular phylogenetic and biophysical considerations are the basis of the 
work.

Mathematical models of living cells have been successively refined with 
advancements in experimental techniques. A main concern is striking a balance 
between modelling power and the tractability of the associated mathematical 
analysis. In this work we model the dynamics for the transcription factor Hairy 
and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1), whose expression oscillates during neural 
development, and which critically enables stable fate decision in the embryonic 
brain. We design, parametrise, and analyse a detailed spatial model using 
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) over a grid capturing both transient 
oscillatory behaviour and fate decision on a population-level. We also 
investigate the relationship between this ODE model and a more realistic 
grid-based model involving intrinsic noise using mostly directly biologically 
motivated parameters. While we focus specifically on Hes1 in neural development, 
the approach of linking deterministic and stochastic grid-based models shows 
promise in modelling various biological processes taking place in a cell 
population. In this context, our work stresses the importance of the 
interpretability of complex computational models into a framework which is 
amenable to mathematical analysis.

Doxorubicin (DOX), although effective in treating cancer, has significant 
cardiac side effects, which limit its clinical utility. In this study, we 
collected time-course transcriptomics and metabolomics data from the human 
cardiomyocyte cell line AC16, which we analyzed along with curated public 
transcriptomics data on DOX-induced toxicity. We developed a multiomics analysis 
workflow and a computational toolbox, pipeGEM, to integrate RNA-seq data with 
metabolic models, enabling the simulation of DOX-induced metabolic perturbations 
at a sample-specific level. Our results revealed that DOX affected mitochondrial 
damage and mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling, potentially 
contributing to the observed cellular enlargement, senescence and metabolic 
shift. Cardiac cells that survived DOX treatment presented elevated glycolysis, 
increased pentose phosphate pathway activity, an altered TCA cycle, and modified 
glutathione and fatty acid metabolism. These findings provide a comprehensive 
understanding of DOX-induced toxicity and its implications for cardiac 
hypertrophy, suggesting potential strategies to mitigate side effects while 
retaining the anticancer efficacy of DOX.

Liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules is increasingly recognized as 
being relevant to various cellular functions, and complex coacervation of 
biomacromolecules, particularly proteins, is emerging as a key mechanism for 
this phenomenon. Complex coacervation is also being explored as a potential 
protein purification method due to its potential scalability, aqueous operation, 
and ability to produce a highly concentrated product. However, to date, most 
studies of complex coacervation have evaluated the phase behavior of a binary 
mixture of two oppositely charged macromolecules. Therefore, a comprehensive 
understanding of the phase behavior of complex biological mixtures is yet to be 
established. To address this, a panel of engineered proteins was designed to 
allow for quantitative analysis of the complex coacervation of individual 
proteins within a multicomponent mixture. The behavior of individual proteins 
was evaluated using a defined mixture of proteins that mimics the charge profile 
of the Escherichia coli proteome. To allow for the direct quantification of 
proteins in each phase, spectrally separated fluorescent proteins were used to 
construct the protein mixture. From this quantitative analysis, we observed that 
protein coacervation was synchronized in the mixture, which was distinctive from 
the behavior when each protein was evaluated in a single-protein system. Subtle 
differences in biophysical properties between the proteins, such as the 
ionization of individual charged residues and overall charge density, became 
noticeable in the mixture, which allowed us to elucidate parameters for protein 
complex coacervation. With this understanding, we successfully designed methods 
to enrich a range of proteins of interest from a mixture of proteins.

Ultraviolet (UV) crosslinking with mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has been 
established for identifying RNA- and DNA-binding proteins along with their 
domains and amino acids involved. Here, we explore chemical XL-MS for 
RNA-protein, DNA-protein, and nucleotide-protein complexes in vitro and in vivo. 
We introduce a specialized nucleotide-protein-crosslink search engine, NuXL, for 
robust and fast identification of such crosslinks at amino acid resolution. 
Chemical XL-MS complements UV XL-MS by generating different crosslink species, 
increasing crosslinked protein yields in vivo almost four-fold, and thus it 
expands the structural information accessible via XL-MS. Our workflow 
facilitates integrative structural modelling of nucleic acid-protein complexes 
and adds spatial information to the described RNA-binding properties of enzymes, 
for which crosslinking sites are often observed close to their cofactor-binding 
domains. In vivo UV and chemical XL-MS data from E. coli cells analysed by NuXL 
establish a comprehensive nucleic acid-protein crosslink inventory with 
crosslink sites at amino acid level for >1500 proteins. Our new workflow 
combined with the dedicated NuXL search engine identified RNA crosslinks that 
cover most RNA-binding proteins, with DNA and RNA crosslinks detected in 
transcriptional repressors and activators.

Chaperonins are large barrel-shaped complexes that mediate ATP-dependent protein 
folding1-3. The bacterial chaperonin GroEL forms juxtaposed rings that bind 
unfolded protein and the lid-shaped cofactor GroES at their apertures. In vitro 
analyses of the chaperonin reaction have shown that substrate protein folds, 
unimpaired by aggregation, while transiently encapsulated in the GroEL central 
cavity by GroES4-6. To determine the functional stoichiometry of GroEL, GroES 
and client protein in situ, here we visualized chaperonin complexes in their 
natural cellular environment using cryo-electron tomography. We find that, under 
various growth conditions, around 55-70% of GroEL binds GroES asymmetrically on 
one ring, with the remainder populating symmetrical complexes. Bound substrate 
protein is detected on the free ring of the asymmetrical complex, defining the 
substrate acceptor state. In situ analysis of GroEL-GroES chambers, validated by 
high-resolution structures obtained in vitro, showed the presence of 
encapsulated substrate protein in a folded state before release into the 
cytosol. Based on a comprehensive quantification and conformational analysis of 
chaperonin complexes, we propose a GroEL-GroES reaction cycle that consists of 
linked asymmetrical and symmetrical subreactions mediating protein folding. Our 
findings illuminate the native conformational and functional chaperonin cycle 
directly within cells.

Bispecific monoclonal antibodies (bsmAbs) are expected to provide targeted drug 
delivery that overcomes the dose-limiting toxicities often accompanying 
antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) in clinical practice. Much attention has been 
paid in the past to target selection, mAb affinities and the payload linker 
design, but challenges remain. Here, we demonstrate, by physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) in silico modeling and simulation, that the 
tissue-targeting accuracy of mono- and bispecific antibody therapeutics is 
substantially limited by normal physiological characteristics like organ 
volumes, blood flow rates, lymphatic circulation, and rates of extravasation. 
Only a small fraction of blood flows through solid tumor, where the 
diffusion-driven extravasation is relatively slow compared with many other 
organs. EGFR and HER2 are used as model antigens based on their experimentally 
measured tissue and tumor expression levels, but the approach is generic and can 
account for the cellular expression variation of targets. The model confirms 
experimental observations that only about 0.1-1% of the dosed mAb is likely to 
reach the tumor, while the rest ends up in healthy tissues due to 
target-mediated internalization and nonspecific uptake. The model suggests that 
the dual-positive tumor cell targeting specificity with bispecific antibodies is 
likely to be higher at lower drug concentrations and doses. However, this can be 
offset by elevated drug exposure in more accessible healthy tissues, primarily 
endothelium. The balance of exposure can be shifted toward tumor cells by using 
higher doses, albeit at the expense of more extensive target engagement 
elsewhere in the body, suggesting the need to adapt the toxicity of the payload 
if ADCs are considered. We suggest that PBPK modeling can guide and support 
biologics and bsmAb development, from target evaluation and drug optimization to 
therapeutic dose selection.

Nearly neutral theory predicts that species with higher effective population 
size (Ne) are better at purging slightly deleterious mutations. We compare 
evolution in high- Ne vs. low- Ne vertebrates to reveal subtle selective 
preferences among amino acids. We take three complementary approaches. First, we 
fit non-stationary substitution models using maximum likelihood, comparing the 
high- Ne clade of rodents and lagomorphs to its low- Ne sister clade of primates 
and colugos. Second, we compared evolutionary outcomes across a wider range of 
vertebrates, via correlations between amino acid frequencies and Ne . Third, we 
dissected which amino acids substitutions occurred in human, chimpanzee, mouse, 
and rat, as scored by parsimony - this also enabled comparison to a historical 
paper. All methods agree on amino acid preference under more effective 
selection. Preferred amino acids are less costly to synthesize and use GC-rich 
codons, which are hard to maintain under AT-biased mutation. These factors 
explain 85% of the variance in amino acid preferences. Parsimony-induced bias in 
the historical study produces an apparent reduction in structural disorder, 
perhaps driven by slightly deleterious substitutions in rapidly evolving 
regions. Within highly exchangeable pairs of amino acids, arginine is strongly 
preferred over lysine, aspartate over glutamate, and valine over isoleucine, 
consistent with more effective selection preferring a marginally larger free 
energy of folding. Two of these preferences (K→R and I→V), but not a third (E→D) 
match differences between thermophiles and mesophilic relatives. These results 
reveal the biophysical consequences of mutation-selection-drift balance, and 
demonstrate the utility of nearly neutral theory for understanding protein 
evolution.

Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured 
and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily 
available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among 
modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse 
and visualise, and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret 
or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a 
typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways 
essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways 
carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, 
and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on 
these central metabolic subsystems, we present iCH360, a manually curated 
medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied 
bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most 
recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of 
database annotations and a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We 
enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and 
quantitative data, including thermodynamic and kinetic constants, enhancing the 
scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of 
this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of 
the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including 
enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and 
thermodynamic analysis. Overall, this model holds the potential to become a 
reference medium-scale metabolic model for E. coli.

The outbreak of COVID-19, led to an ongoing pandemic with devastating 
consequences for the global economy and human health. With the global spread of 
SARS-CoV-2, multidisciplinary initiatives were launched to explore new 
diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccination strategies. From this perspective, 
proteomics could help to understand the mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 
infection and to identify new therapeutic options. A TMT-based quantitative 
proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis was performed to study the proteome 
remodeling of human lung alveolar cells expressing human ACE2 (A549-ACE2) after 
infection with SARS-CoV-2. Detectability and the prognostic value of selected 
proteins was analyzed by targeted PRM. A total of 6802 proteins and 6428 
phospho-sites were identified in A549-ACE2 cells after infection with 
SARS-CoV-2. The differential proteins here identified revealed that A549-ACE2 
cells undergo a time-dependent regulation of essential processes, delineating 
the precise intervention of the cellular machinery by the viral proteins. From 
this mechanistic background and by applying machine learning modeling, 29 
differential proteins were selected and detected in the serum of COVID-19 
patients, 14 of which showed promising prognostic capacity. Targeting these 
proteins and the protein kinases responsible for the reported phosphorylation 
changes may provide efficient alternative strategies for the clinical management 
of COVID-19.

Transient expression in Tobacco is a popular way to produce recombinant proteins 
in plants. The design of various expression vectors, delivered into the plant by 
Agrobacterium, has enabled high production levels of some proteins. To further 
enhance expression, researchers often adapt the coding sequence of heterologous 
genes to the host, but this strategy has produced mixed results in Tobacco. To 
study the effects of different sequence features on protein yield, we compile a 
dataset of the yields and coding sequences of previously published expression 
studies of more than 200 coding sequences. We evaluate various established gene 
expression models on a subset of the expression studies. We find that use of 
tobacco codons is only moderately predictive of protein yield as informative 
sequence features likely extend over multiple codons. Additionally, we show that 
codon usage of organisms that use tobacco as a host for expression of their 
proteins in a similar way as the synthetic system, like viruses and 
agrobacteria, can be used to predict heterologous expression. Other predictive 
features are related to tRNA supply and demand, the inclusion of a translational 
ramp of codons with lower adaptation to the tRNA pool at the beginning of the 
coding region, and the amino acid composition of the recombinant protein. A 
model based on all the features achieved a correlation of 0.57 with protein 
yield. We believe that our study provides a practical guideline for coding 
sequence design for efficient expression in tobacco.

While more data are becoming available on gene activity at different levels of 
biological organization, our understanding of the underlying biology remains 
incomplete. Here, we introduce a metabolic efficiency framework that considers 
highly expressed proteins (HEPs), their length, and biosynthetic costs in terms 
of the amino acids (AAs) they contain to address the observed balance of 
expression costs in cells, tissues, and cancer transformation. Notably, the 
combined set of HEPs in either cells or tissues shows an abundance of large and 
costly proteins, yet tissues compensate this with short HEPs comprised of 
economical AAs, indicating a stronger tendency toward mitigating costs. We 
additionally observe that short proteins are prevalent HEPs across individual 
cells and tissues, whereas long ones are more specific. Furthermore, the precise 
proportion of short, long, economical, or costly HEP classes indicates that 
particular cell types and tissues align more closely with the metabolic 
efficiency model, with some tissues displaying behavior akin to their 
constituent cells. Finally, tumors typically increase the production of short 
and low-cost HEPs compared with matched normal tissues, while genes that 
decrease their high expression levels in tumors often tend to be associated with 
high costs. Overall, the metabolic efficiency framework serves as a useful 
simplifying model for interpreting genome-wide expression data across scales.

Despite abundant genomic and phenotypic data across individuals and 
environments, the functional impact of most mutations on phenotype remains 
unclear. Here, we bridge this gap by linking genome to proteome in 800 meiotic 
progeny from an intercross between two closely related Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
isolates adapted to distinct niches. Modest genetic distance between the parents 
generated remarkable proteomic diversity that was amplified in the progeny and 
captured by 6,476 genotype-protein associations, over 1,600 of which we resolved 
to single variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged through the combined action of 
numerous cis- and trans-regulatory mutations, a regulatory architecture that was 
conserved across the species. Notably, trans-regulatory variants often arose in 
proteins not traditionally associated with gene regulation, such as enzymes. 
Moreover, the proteomic consequences of mutations predicted fitness under 
various stresses. Our study demonstrates that the collective action of natural 
genetic variants drives dramatic proteome diversification, with molecular 
consequences that forecast phenotypic outcomes.

Yme1 is a conserved ATP-dependent protease that maintains mitochondrial function 
by degrading proteins in the intermembrane space. However, how Yme1 selects 
substrates within the crowded mitochondrial environment is poorly understood. An 
established substrate of Yme1 in yeast is the Tim10 subunit of the small 
Tim9-Tim10 protein chaperone complex, which is degraded following disruption of 
the subunit's internal disulfide bonds. Here, we use biochemical and biophysical 
approaches to examine initial substrate binding and degradation of small Tim 
proteins by Yme1 and shed light on the molecular mechanism of substrate 
selection. We show that Yme1 preferentially binds Tim10 over other small Tim 
proteins by forming a high-affinity interaction with the subunit irrespective of 
the presence of its disulfide bonds. This interaction is primarily mediated by 
Tim10's flexible N-terminal 'tentacle', though substrate unfolding exposes 
additional contact sites that enhance engagement. Notably, the human ortholog 
TIMM13 is also recognized by yeast Yme1, suggesting conservation of recognition 
strategy across species. Yme1 also binds to the assembled Tim9-Tim10 chaperone 
but independently of the Tim10 N-terminal tentacle. These findings suggest that 
Yme1 surveils the folding state of Tim10 throughout its functional lifecycle - 
both as a folded monomer and as a subunit of the functional chaperone complex - 
but only commits to degradation after disruption of its disulfide bonds.

Model-informed drug discovery advocates the use of mathematical modeling and 
simulation for improved efficacy in drug discovery. In the case of monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) against cell membrane antigens, this requires quantitative 
insight into the target tissue concentration levels. Protein mass spectrometry 
data are often available but the values are expressed in relative, rather than 
in molar concentration units that are easier to incorporate into pharmacokinetic 
models. Here, we present an empirical correlation that converts the parts per 
million (ppm) concentrations in the PaxDb database to their molar equivalents 
that are more suitable for pharmacokinetic modeling. We evaluate the insight 
afforded to target tissue distribution by analyzing the likely tumor-targeting 
accuracy of mAbs recognizing either epidermal growth factor receptor or its 
homolog HER2. Surprisingly, the predicted tissue concentrations of both these 
targets exceed the Kd values of their respective therapeutic mAbs. 
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling indicates that in these 
conditions only about 0.05% of the dosed mAb is likely to reach the solid tumor 
target cells. The rest of the dose is eliminated in healthy tissues via both 
nonspecific and target-mediated processes. The presented approach allows 
evaluation of the interplay between the target expression level in different 
tissues that determines the overall pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and 
the fraction that reaches the cells of interest. This methodology can help to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety properties of novel drugs, especially if the 
off-target cell degradation has cytotoxic outcomes, as in the case of 
antibody-drug conjugates.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway regulates cell 
growth and metabolism in response to many environmental cues, including 
nutrients. Amino acids signal to mTORC1 by modulating the guanine nucleotide 
loading states of the heterodimeric Rag GTPases, which bind and recruit mTORC1 
to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. The Rag GTPases are tethered 
to the lysosome by the Ragulator complex and regulated by the GATOR1, GATOR2, 
and KICSTOR multiprotein complexes that localize to the lysosomal surface 
through an unknown mechanism(s). Here, we show that mTORC1 is completely 
insensitive to amino acids in cells lacking the Rag GTPases or the Ragulator 
component p18. Moreover, not only are the Rag GTPases and Ragulator required for 
amino acids to regulate mTORC1, they are also essential for the lysosomal 
recruitment of the GATOR1, GATOR2, and KICSTOR complexes, which stably associate 
and traffic to the lysosome as the "GATOR" supercomplex. The nucleotide state of 
RagA/B controls the lysosomal association of GATOR, in a fashion competitively 
antagonized by the N terminus of the amino acid transporter SLC38A9. Targeting 
of Ragulator to the surface of mitochondria is sufficient to relocalize the Rags 
and GATOR to this organelle, but not to enable the nutrient-regulated 
recruitment of mTORC1 to mitochondria. Thus, our results reveal that the 
Rag-Ragulator complex is the central organizer of the physical architecture of 
the mTORC1 nutrient-sensing pathway and underscore that mTORC1 activation 
requires signal transduction on the lysosomal surface.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent type of head and neck cancer, 
comprising over 90% of all oral malignancies worldwide. The identification of 
diagnostic and prognostic markers for OSCC is crucial for improving patient 
outcomes, as early detection and treatment are critical for the successful 
management of this disease. Previously, we demonstrated that N-myc 
downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) are 
prognostic markers for OSCC; however, their role in OSCC development remains 
unclear. To investigate this, we used TurboID-based proximity labeling to 
identify the interactomes of NDRG1 and PGK1 in HEK293 cells. Herein, protein 
abundance patterns from three time points were used for clustering 364 proteins 
with a "fast" or "slow" response to biotin. Of these, 65 proteins were also 
identified in neoplastic islands of OSCC patients from our previous study, and 
28 of these proteins have their gene expression associated with prognostic 
features, including death, metastasis, and relapse. PRM-MS enabled the 
quantification of 17 of these proteins, providing further evidence of their 
presence in the OSCC prognostic interactome. Finally, we characterized a 
prognostic-associated interactome composed of 28 proteins, which enabled the 
prioritization of candidates that can be further explored in OSCC progression.

ProteomeXchange with the data set identifier PXD048046.

Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles that mediate central metabolic functions, 
such as fatty acid β-oxidation, as well as diverse tissue- and organism-specific 
processes. Membrane contact sites, regions of close apposition with other 
organelles for direct communication, are central to several aspects of their 
life cycle. Pex3 is a conserved multifunctional peroxisomal transmembrane 
protein that is involved in the insertion of peroxisomal membrane proteins, in 
pexophagy, and in the formation of membrane contact sites. Here, we show that 
high Pex3 levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae induce the formation of peroxisome 
clusters surrounded by lipid droplets, mediated by peroxisome-peroxisome and 
peroxisome-lipid droplet contact sites. This clustering occurs independently of 
Pex3 partners in other processes Pex19, Inp1, and Atg36. The cytosolic domain of 
Pex3 binds peroxisomes, suggesting a direct role in homotypic contact site 
formation. Lipid droplet-peroxisome contact sites require the lipid 
droplet-localized triacylglycerol lipase Tgl4, which is enriched at this 
interface along with other lipases. Pex3 overexpression in Drosophila 
melanogaster similarly alters peroxisome and lipid droplet morphology and 
promotes contact site formation. Together, our results offer novel molecular 
insights into homotypic peroxisome contact sites and peroxisome-lipid droplet 
contact sites across species.

Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a multifunctional chromatin-associated 
protein conserved from fission yeast to mammals. HP1 has been suggested to drive 
heterochromatin formation via phase separation. However, there is seemingly 
conflicting evidence about HP1 phase-separating in different systems or not. 
Here, we assess the phase separation behavior of HP1 from fission yeast, fruit 
fly and mouse in vitro and in mammalian cells side-by-side. We find that HP1 
from fission yeast and fly can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation and induce 
heterochromatin coalescence in mouse cells, in stark contrast to HP1 from mouse. 
Induced heterochromatin coalescence has only mild effects on gene expression. We 
link the decreasing phase separation propensity of HP1 homologs to their 
decreasing intrinsic disorder and their increasing sensitivity to HP1 paralogs 
antagonizing phase separation. Our work elucidates the relationship between 
phase separation, nuclear organization and gene expression, and highlights the 
evolutionary dimension of protein phase separation control.

Pathological cardiac remodeling is associated with the reactivation of fetal 
genes, yet the extent of the heart's fetal gene program and its impact on 
proteome compositions remain incompletely understood. Here, using a 
proteome-wide protein ratio quantification strategy with mass spectrometry, we 
identified pervasive isoform usage shifts in fetal and postnatal mouse hearts, 
involving 145 pairs of highly homologous paralogs and alternative 
splicing-derived isoform proteins. Proteome-wide ratio comparisons readily 
rediscovered hallmark fetal gene signatures in muscle contraction and glucose 
metabolism pathways, while revealing what we believe to be previously 
undescribed isoform usage in mitochondrial and gene-expression-regulating 
proteins, including PPA1/PPA2, ANT1/ANT2, and PCBP1/PCBP2 switches. Paralogs 
with differential fetal usage tend to be evolutionarily recent, consistent with 
functional diversification. Alternative splicing adds another rich source of 
fetal isoform usage differences, involving PKM M1/M2, GLS1 KGA/GAC, PDLIM5 
long/short, and other spliceoforms. When comparing absolute protein proportions, 
we observed a partial reversion toward fetal gene usage in pathological hearts. 
In summary, we present a ratiometric catalog of paralogs and spliceoform pairs 
in the cardiac fetal gene program. More generally, the results demonstrate the 
potential of applying the proteome-wide ratio test concept to discover new 
regulatory modalities beyond differential gene expression.
