An organelle-specific protein landscape identifies novel diseases and molecular mechanisms	"Although we did not determine stoichiometries of the complexes, comparison of known protein levels across many cell types shows that they are nevertheless stoichiometrically logical: there are few complex cores where one component has a wildly different abundance from the others. Overall, the median differences in abundancies are significantly lower (t-test P<0.0001) when looking at proteins within complexes (23.6 p.p.m.) compared with those between complexes (126 p.p.m.) or involving proteins that were detected in the screen but not in any significant interactions (140 p.p.m.). This suggests that the socioaffinity filtering is effective at removing non-specific components and identifying complexes that are stoichiometrically sensible."		2016	https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11491	Stoichiometry

The nitrogen cost of photosynthesis 	"Using MS, thousands of proteins and their relative abundance in a range of organisms have been measured. The PaxDb resource (Wang et al., 2015) provides estimates of protein abundance derived from spectral counts across many experiments and tissue types. The Arabidopsis thaliana database comprises 46 datasets, covering 76% of the expected proteome. More than 90% of protein is accounted for by the 1000 most-abundant proteins. However, protein quantification by MS has an inherent bias, over-representing more-abundant proteins when low-abundance proteins fall below the instrument detection limits. Identification of proteins by MS can also be biased due to a range of factors affecting peptide detection, such as peptide solubility, enzymatic digestion efficacy, and differing ion efficiencies (reviewed in Lundgren et al., 2010). 
Consequently, the PaxDb values cannot be taken at face value (Li et al., 2017). For example, the abundance of Rubisco large subunits outnumbers that of the small subunit by more than 8-fold. One would expect that the amounts of these two subunits should be similar as the mature Rubisco enzyme contains eight large and eight small subunits. Rubisco represents about 40% of soluble protein (Eckardt et al., 1997), or 20% of leaf nitrogen (Evans and Seemann, 1984), which equates to about 119000 ppm for each subunit (see Supplementary Data S1 at JXB online). Because Rubisco is such an abundant protein, this potentially introduces a significant bias unless it is corrected (Li et al., 2017). Further, the stoichiometry in PaxDb of proteins within and between complexes does not necessarily match expectations, perhaps reflecting the fact that not all proteins are quantitatively captured during tissue preparation and subsequent measurement. However, the data available from MS allows a deeper understanding of nitrogen distribution between proteins than previous techniques have afforded. Moving forward, new data-independent acquisition proteomic techniques, such as SWATH MS (Law and Lim, 2013) will allow greater accuracy and a much finer resolution of leaf nitrogen allocation between proteins within leaves."		2019	https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/70/1/7/5142912	
Unification of Protein Abundance Datasets Yields a Quantitative Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteome	"We also considered a normalization scheme where each protein is quantified relative to all other proteins in the dataset, as was done in PaxDb. While this relative expression of abundance (parts per million) has the advantage of being independent of cell size and sample volume, it makes comparison between different datasets difficult if the datasets measure different numbers of proteins. Thus, the parts per million normalization alters the pairwise correlations between datasets (Figure S2C). By contrast, normalization by mode shifting or center log ratio transformation allows comparison between datasets by expressing them on a common scale (Figure S2A), and preserves the correlations that are evident in the raw data (Figure S2C). Normalization by mode shifting or center log ratio transformation also allows us to retain proteins whose abundance is not reported in all datasets, thereby affording the greatest possible proteome coverage."		2018	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240547121730546X?via%3Dihub

Design of typical genes for heterologous gene expression	"The annotation of the sequence data (e.g. cellular localization, biomolecular function) and the reference to the protein abundance data (from PacDB) allows the generation of organism-specific and gene set-specific RSdCU computations for the Markov chain model. For example, based on the protein abundance information just the 50 highest expressed proteins of an organism could be selected, or the 2000 least expressed proteins. In other use cases, for example, the ATPases, membrane proteins, or cytoskeletal proteins of an organism could be selected to generate the RSdCU matrix. This approach allows the flexible computation of the RSdCU for a diverse set of organisms as target hosts, for a set of proteins with similar expression level, and for a selected set of proteins with similar cellular function."		2022	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13089-1	"Synthetic biology, create gene sequence for protein production, codon bias "

A conserved NAD+ binding pocket that regulates protein-protein interactions during aging	"The protein DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) is one of the most abundant yet enigmatic proteins in mammals (10, 11), "			https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aad8242	
The Unfolded Protein Response: Detecting and Responding to Fluctuations in the Protein-Folding Capacity of the Endoplasmic Reticulum	"It is notable that translocons are highly abundant, present at levels at least an order of magnitude higher than those of IRE1 (Wang et al. 2015). Such disparate stoichiometry suggests that IRE1 associates with specialized translocon complexes that might be involved in the translocation of select ER clients.

"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate couples glycolytic flux to activation of Ras"	"Moreover, at least in yeast, the number of Cdc25 molecules is very low compared to the number of Ras molecules55. Hence, a second way in which faster dissociation of Cdc25 and Ras may stimulate Ras activity, is that it may make the limited number of Cdc25 molecules more rapidly available for activation of other Ras molecules."			https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01019-z	Speculate “signaling molecule” function by ratio of two protein abundance

Cytosolic Protein Vms1 Links Ribosome Quality Control to Mitochondrial and Cellular Homeostasis	"We found that overexpression of Vms1 caused the displacement of Rqc2 from 60S ribosomes, providing a mechanism for how Vms1 impedes CAT tailing. Vms1 may directly compete with Rqc2 for 60S binding, consistent with Vms1 and Rqc2 being of similar abundance"		2017	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417311868	Speculate about function “compete” comparing normal condition and over expression
Operon Gene Order Is Optimized for Ordered Protein Complex Assembly	"Unsurprisingly, it has been observed that proteins encoded by the same operon tend to be coexpressed (Wang et al., 2005). "			https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124715015417	Within group (operon)

Localized redox relays as a privileged mode of cytoplasmic hydrogen peroxide signaling	"Furthermore, recent quantitative proteomic studies of multiple human cell lines and tissues [11] consistently show that glutathione peroxidases are one to two orders of magnitude less abundant than PrxI and PrxII. The neglect of alternative H2O2 sinks is a conservative assumption with respect to the H2O2 attained in the cytoplasm.
